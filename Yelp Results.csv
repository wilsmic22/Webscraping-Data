By the time I was done, I was starving! I hadn't been to this location since our kids were teenagers and I didn't realize that they started serving lunch about a year ago. After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed."

Went there for my birthday recently and had an absolutely fabulous time. The food was delicious but you have to know what to order. The meatballs, meatballs, meatballs galore! Do yourself a favor and order the Brussels sprouts, garlic cheese bread and a pizza too! Also don't forget a few 22oz beers ;)
The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is ridiculous and festive and the laughter fills the dining room and goes through the roof. The place is clean and well maintained, decorations everywhere.
Highly recommended :)"

It's perfect for a large group of hungry people. Portions are huge! You'll have food for days!
The decor of the restaurant is basically your classic Italian restaurant.
The place is also kids friendly. Kids get crayons to draw.
The servers are also really nice and efficient."

Atmosphere: very old school traditional/stereotypical Italian restaurant with the red & white table cloths and Christmas decor all around. Large pasta sauces every where and pictures of people that have eaten there on the walls.
Food:
Huge portions - they only feed 3 (small) or 5 (large) and there's still plenty for leftovers. I come here with my partner and we get the small, and between the two of us, we can get in a total of 6 meals (so once sit down and 2 times eating the leftovers). But that applied mainly to their Sunday Family Dinners which I think is the best deal. You get garlic bread, salad, sausage, meatballs, and a giant bowl of ziti. We've come here many times for this special and it feeds up halfway through the week. Highly recommend!
+ We've come here for their other pastas as well and I have not been disappointed with their flavors. If you come here just for the pastas, I'd recommend coming with a group because if you order just one dish, there's a lack of variety. That's why some people complain about the prices. It really should be family style.
Overall, I highly recommend Bucca for their Sunday Family Dinners and Half Off Meatball Mondays. Otherwise, if you come here with a large group, it's good to order just a few dishes to share to offset the prices."

Went there for lunch with a party of a dozen people on a weekday, and we were one of the first parties to arrive. Mid-size interior with interesting decor. Services was pretty good.
Their menu has individual-portion options, but they also have a lot family-style options that's meant to serve a couple of people. We ended up ordering two salads, three pastas, and two tiramisu cakes for dessert. The salad, pasta and garlic bread servings were huge. We probably finished less than half of the food. I like the garlic bread and the tiramasu. The pasta and the salads were alright. Lots of quantity, but average quality. Two of the pastas looked and tasted kind of the same even though one was supposed to be spicy. Overall, a decent option to feed Italian food to large parties."

Please hire safe drivers that won't curse and scream out of their cars while making illegal turns in a buca vehicle. It was absolutely insane.
This is regarding an incident around noon on 5/30/19.
I was in a right turn lane on Howell and Boren turning, when the buca car pulled up next to me (from behind) in the middle no turn lane. Oncoming traffic made it impossible to make the turn for a bit, but seems like she got impatient.
She pulled up and started screaming obscenities, pulled up in the middle of the intersection, illegally blocking, then made an illegal turn while continuing to screech at me.
So angry Seattle driving, just in a buca car and on meth.
Not a great look.
Please sit down and have a conversation with your staff about driving like normal people.
I road rage too--everyone does from time to time. But your drivers endangered people around them, and that driver at noon today should not be driving for you, let alone on the road to begin with.
In terms of food, I did like the pasta month a couple months back. The pappardele was great. But it's not worth supporting a business that endangers peoples lives."

This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"

My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."

Cool, chill, vibe. Super low key. Little bit hidden but follow the signs down the stairs. We didn't have to wait and were seated right away. We got two cocktails and be warned they are super strong.
They have a large selection of different kinds of drinks as well as a late night menu. We didn't try any of the food but it all looked amazing."

There's so many places to choose from right here in the Pike Place Market area. Lucky me, I landed at Zig Zag!
Service from Anna and Erin was spot on a dm fabulous. Technically, I believe Anna was my server yet Erin bought several things and was very attentive as well. It kinda worked as tag team service and that was just fabulous!
All the food was spot on, they had plenty of gluten-free options and the happy hour wine was very good.
My only complaint is that I ate way too much because the food was so great! My hotel is around one plus miles ...uphill. Ugh. It'll be good for me, right?!? Super good, I'll be back!"

Also the cheese just oozed out of everywhere. Very delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my taste though. Score: 5/5
Their snacks were very boring. The baguette with the cultured butter was good though. It comes toasted but my only compliant is that I eat too fast and the outside of the bread is too hard :(
The cheese platter was smelly!!!! It's not my cup of tea but I'm sure other people will love it"

Great cozy restaurant and their service was fantastic. Small selections of wines but they were really good wines and reasonable.
Ordered A charcuterie plate, fried oysters, burgers and mussels. The plate was so tasty and the meats were perfectly cured, their mousse was just melt in my mouth.
Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"

Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"

Came here for a special occasion with my S.O. Started with a half bottle of local wine and their meat and cheese board. The meats varied from fatty, to hard, to spicy, to earthy. The cheeses were a medium and a soft cheese. Sides of spicy mustard and slightly sweet jam. This was a delicious board that we almost finished in its entirety.
For dinner I had the rigatoni with meatballs. And she had the lasagna. Mmmm the rigatoni was cooked perfectly, with just enough of a bite. The sauce was bright and fresh, if not a bit sour. I would personally add a bit of sugar to offset, but it was delicious nonetheless.
I had a few bites of the lasagna, I have tasted few lasagnas that come close. The spinach gave the pasta an elegant green hue, and their cheese was melted to a perfect cream consistency. The layer of pesto really gave this dish the richness that made it so special. Highly recommend the lasagna.
Finally, we finished off with espresso and their cheesecake. The cheesecake was hazelnut flavored and was very good. The hazelnut creme was just sweet enough. If you are a fan of hazelnut you will like this. Otherwise I could have done with a different flavor cheesecake.
Overall the food was fantastic. And the location and decor made dinner that much more special. I couldn't imagine a cozier restaurant. Dinner felt intimate. And the service was good. I will be back!"

With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront.
They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors.
This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance."

I'd remarked on our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary (15 years!!) and when we sat down the server brought out complimentary glasses of Prosecco for toasting. What a special touch!
We ordered several things I can't pronounce but this has to be one of the top tasting meals I've had.

While entrees here can cost $20-30 each, its nice to see that it's not fine dining to the extent where its tiny portions, but you get a nice hefty plate with great preparation.

Winter Risotto | Must. Order. Creamy butternut squash risotto that warms up your entire heart...
Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!
Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!

Went for dinner on our first anniversary. Didn't reserve the table early, so got the slot at 10:15 pm. :( but got the table with the best view.
Food is always good. They have one of the best oysters in the city. So highly recommended. Other foods are also good.

We ordered the rabbit ragu pasta and cioppino soup.

Linguine Alle Vongole - obsessed with this dish. Baby clams in shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis in a light white wine sauce. Clams for days, linguine perfectly al dente.
Lasagna - an interesting house version with super thin sheets of spinach pasta, layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara - flavorful artistry, no dull, heavy lasagna here.
Crab risotto - chockfull of crab! A beautiful risotto, albeit not as interesting as the linguine or lasagna

Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place. So, I had to...
But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find. Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building. Really no way to know how to get there without being told...
and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those. First, it's in an alley. Luckily the GPS does hint at that. BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?) The door IS NOT PINK. So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door.
Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance. So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe. Interesting.
Food though is above average but not particularly great...
1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"": Don't. Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade. Mocktail my ass. 1/10
2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"": I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close. I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it! Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping. As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener? Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special. 6/10
3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"": Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor. It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants. The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh. The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist. Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food. Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served??? No toast, no nothing. Weird huh? 6/10
4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"": Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising. It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top. I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert. But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat. 6/10
I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so...
(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)
Oooooooooooooooooh f it.... I guess it's worth a special visit just cuz... (but seriously, the food is just a 3)
4/5

"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica M.","Came here for my birthday and I had the perfect experience. They had no more available reservations but accept walk-ins. We read from previous yelp reviews to expect a wait so we stopped by a little earlier to put our name and number down. We were told a 45 minute wait and our table was ready for us by the time we made our way back.
For starters, we ordered the Crostini Ai Funghi (mushroom on grilled toast). The mushrooms were flavorful and the toast was crispy! I love Linguine alle Vongole so this was a must. Definitely the highlight of the meal. Clams were fresh and the linguine was cooked to perfection.
Although the place was packed with people, our attentive server was able to bring out our meals quickly. This is a great restaurant for date night or hanging out with friends. Highly recommend - just try to make reservations beforehand."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer K.","This was probably one of my top favorite dining experiences in all of my travels. My husband's friend had mentioned this place, otherwise we would've had no idea and weren't planning on eating here. It's actually pretty hidden and you definitely need reservations, which I managed to get pretty last minute (visiting off season in January). The interior is very unique, it has an art deco/1920's vibe which I love. They actually have live trapeze artists on weekends, they perform above you while you eat. Unfortunately we missed that being a weeknight, but it was still a very entertaining evening. They had live jazz performers, and the atmosphere is just so lively. It has a beautiful view of the water if you're lucky to sit in the back area.
The food was delicious! We had Lasagne with besciamella, pesto, & marinara *new york steak with twice baked potatoes *caesar salad with crab and *maple creme brulee."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Katie Y.","God, I just love this place. The first time I came here was for my 16th birthday (quite a few years ago.. yikes), and the last time I came here was over 10 years later. It's just as good, if not better, than I remember it.
We came here right when it opened on a weekend, put our name in and got seated maybe 30-45m later. I'd recommend making reservations in advance if you can. The restaurant is a little hard to find the first time, walk down Post Alley and literally look for an unmarked pink door. Inside, it's surprisingly big with high ceilings as you walk down and start to realize how eclectic and funky it is inside.
The hype is so real about this place. We ordered charcuterie (both meat and cheese boards) and both were fantastic. The pastas did not disappoint, the risotto basically tastes like butter.. but in pasta form, if you're into that (butter, that is). Honestly, everything I've ever tasted here has been nothing short of amazing. If this place weren't so hard to get to (in an alley of Pike Place), hard to find parking, and hard to get reservations/a table, I probably wouldn't wait so many years between visits."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Douglas R.","The Pink Door is straight fire.
Background: In Seattle for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later. Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty of getting a reservation.
The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night.
What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown.
Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing.
Service:Great all the way around.
Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa E.","There is a reason The Pink Door has so many great reviews, it is pretty fabulous. Is it a bit touristy and right near the fish market? Yes...but it is not just a cliche tourist joint. The Pink Door has great food and atmosphere! I have never had a bad thing here.
If you like oysters, get their oysters. They are delicious, and I love their peppery vinaigrette mixture that comes with it and the presentation is lovely.
I have had their seafood specials, pasta specials and just salads here and have never been disappointed. My customer once had a risotto here that she said was a bit bland, but other than that I cannot think of any complaints.
The bar makes fabulous drinks, and they have a great variety of unique liquors. The entertainment is what I believe the Pink Door is known for, and the hostesses do a great job trying to accommodate all patrons trying to see the stage. The atmosphere is grand and a bit over the top as you would expect. In general this is great for a cozy date, or even a lively business dinner. All clients and colleagues I have brought to the Pink Door have not been disappointed."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Tazeen L.","Great spot with a fun atmosphere, great views, occasional music and good food... came in without a reservation and had a 1.5 hr wait for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and helpful, ended up sharing a few things:
-lasagna- recommended by waiter and definitely the winner - great balance of ingredients, well seasoned, everything you want out of cheesy comforting plate of pasta
- cioppino- seafood was fresh & tender, could have had more variety (mainly mussels and shrimp). Broth was light, could have used more seasoning
- pappardelle- noodles were al dente, ragu was good
Overall good spot if you can get a reservation..."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Ce O.","Came for our last supper in Seattle. We had Spiced Wine and The Butler to drink. To eat, I had the pappardelle bolognese. My partner had the lasagna. Both dishes were delicious but we could have used several more bites of each. I imagine that they don't make the main entrees larger so that you'll buy dessert. However, we don't eat sweets so we left feeling unfulfilled. The entertainment was a delightful added bonus, though. To get the full enjoyment of the experience, I'd recommend requesting cornered seating, so that half the party's backs aren't to the performer. Otherwise, give it try!"
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen C.","Arguably the most famous Italian restaurant in Seattle. After visiting I can understand why it sometimes can take months to get a reservation at this establishment. The Italian cuisine is on point and the service is impeccable. The restaurant seating is split between a lounge type of seating and a main dining room. We we were unable to get seating within the main dining room and sat in the lounge seating - personally we enjoyed it very much and it was very fitting for lunch. I would not let the unavailability of main dining room deter you from visiting the restaurant.
For drinks, we opted for the freshly squeezed mimosas. It was very well prepared. For appetizers, we ordered a side salad, which was amazing, the perfect amount of dressing and the presentation was great. We also ordered a dozen of the few oysters. As expected the oysters were very fresh and the accompanying mignonette sauce was perfect.
For the main entrees, we opted for probably the most popular dish on the menu, the clam pasta (linguine alle vongole) and also an order of the bolognese pasta. Hands down maybe the best bolognese I have had outside Italy. The clam pasta was also superb, loaded with fresh clams, and with the perfect amount of wine sauce. On a side note, we really appreciated how the restaurant made special arrangements to prepare a children's portion of the bolognese and they were able to plate it earlier than the rest of the meal.
Finished the meal off with an spritz, which would highly recommend for a brunch.
Overall, very pleased with the dining experience at Pink Door. It is no wonder why this restaurant continue to top the list of most popular restaurants in Seattle."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Natalie K.","This is a great Italian spot in Post Alley, it's a little hidden with the Pink Door... come early cause wait time usually is anywhere to 1-2 hours. And reservations are booked 60 days in advanced. You might get lucky and snag a seat at the bar
It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting. Every night they do have live music/ entertainment.
We had a great server, he notified us that the menu changes every week/ holiday season so the pictures that you see you may not be able to order on the menu
To drink we started with Hennessy Sidecars ... can never go wrong
The Pink lasagna... sensational it didn't have meat but the sauce was impeccable and something like you probably have never tried before
The scallops were perfectly seared and crushed with potatoes and a sautéed spinach
The next dish was a Bellachini with Italian sausage... it was a little dry but still yummy with a cheese bite to it.
For desert we had a gelato tri and a chocolate cake with a chocolate coated pear... very rich but nice way to finish dinner off"
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Clarissa K.","This place I had bookmarked by recommendations from my fellow Yelp friends. I should have prepared better as it was truly hard to find located near Pike Place Market on a path that was a back alley. I did not realize that the door is truly a pale pink and in the dark the only way you will know you arrived. But it added to this great find and mysterious local and surroundings. Once inside you feel like you are in London in a hidden location in a basement.
So the wait for a table would be an eternity especially on a Wednesday cold dank evening in November. Luckily there was two seats at the bar so that is where we had our dinner. The menu was unbelievable like reading a poem each one you wanted to try. We sat next to all the regulars they seemed so happy. Great place it truly is one of a kind. We started with a anchovy dip with raw veggies. It was interesting as well as delicious. The main course I shared with my colleague any menu loses me when I see pappardelle noodles with Ragu a la Bolognese sauce. OMG to die for! We had a nice wine to compliment the meal as well as made it warmer before entering the cold Seattle night air. Grand Marnier Panna Cotta with fresh figs for a sweet ending
Will definitely return on my next visit to Seattle."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","Worth the hype. Great mix of flavors on all the dishes. The pasta was my favorite, but the sleeper may be the onions stuffed with sausage. Those were unreal and were generally eaten in one bite.
Cocktail list wasn't too expansive but they had something for everyone. Wine list is extensive and the atmosphere is pretty intimate. We had 5 pm reservations on a Tuesday and the place was packed by the time we left around 7.
Beef cheek was fork tender and dissolves in your mouth."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Trang L.","This restaurant is a must try if you are in Seattle! The hand-cut egg noodles tasted so fresh and perfectly al dente. The pork and beef ragu on top of the egg noodles were good, but a little bland for my taste. I've never had a cabbage salad that tasted so good. The prosciutto and egg added great texture and blended well with the crunchy cabbage. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was used, but it was delicious. The trout was crispy and full if flavor. Finally, the prawn risotto was amazing and a must try! I was so full and didn't have room for dessert.
Restaurant is small and intimate. Service is great!
I would rate this restaurant a 4.5 if I could and would come back again."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen K.","Summary: If you solely come here for a specific pasta dish, you will leave satisfied. But everything else is as unmemorable as it gets- from the service to the house bread to the dessert to the $30 trout (more on this later).
Elon Musk. Stephen Curry. Bill Gates. The Backstreet Boys. What do these transcendent cultural icons all have in common you ask? They went against the grain. Against popular belief. And that is what I must do in saying, aside from one pasta dish, Spinasse is an average restaurant. To say I was hyped to have snagged a reservation on a weeks notice in one of the hardest restaurants to book in the city would be an understatement. And ya know, maybe the high expectations I came with me doomed my experience from the start so I'll take some culpability in the an overall experience that was just really average.
Nestled on the outskirts of Cap Hill, Spinasse exudes a romantic, intimate vibe from the moment you walk in. So at this point I'm thinking okay, this is my last meal with my significant other before they leave Seattle, and we gonna go out with a bang! Spinasse said nah, check yo self.
SIDE NOTE: It's a huge pet peeve of mine when restaurants try and make their menu a version of Webster's Dictionary Word of the Day that us peasants can't understand. Degustanzione, braciola, guancia, tajarin, barbabietole, who knows what these mean! Smh. But I suppose the Italian adds a flare to the authenticity and I'm probably just being dramatic since at least there are descriptions.
We ordered:
1. Tajarin con burro salvia (4/5 Stars) $15 small portion: The ICONIC hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage was light and flavorful. And it also tasted exactly like the Butter and Sage Gnocchi from Trader Joe's. The dish could have perhaps used a little bit more kick, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and marveled at the texture of such finely cut thin noodles. I've never quite eaten a noodle like that, and this brother has had a lot of noodles believe me.
2. Tajarin al ragu (5/5 Stars) $28 large portion: This dish was exemplary. The pork and beef ragu perfectly complimented the egg pasta, and even tasted a little sweet. And honestly, for all my asian noodle folks out there, the first thing I thought of was this meat tastes exactly like the mince pork of Rou Zhao Mian!!! Just Italian style. So that's probably why I loved it so much.
3. Agnolotti dal plin (3/5 Stars) $16 small portion: This is where the meal started going downhill. The agnolottis were absolutely tiny and filled with beef and pork. And while it didn't taste bad, the agnolottis were drowned in shaved cheese and left you feeling simply unsatisfied. I felt like I had to ration every one which was eaten in a half a bite because there were so few and each was so small. Granted we did get the small portion, but if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, this ain't it.
4. Trota (2/5 Stars) $30: I almost fell out of my chair when this came out. Imagine a rectangle in your head, and and add a little fish tail to the end of it. That's exactly how the trout came out. I appreciated the fact that all the bones were plucked out, and the salsa of sage and golden raisins underneath was quite good- but the star of the dish is supposed to be the trout and it was so unmemorable. It had little to no flavor, and the presentation of a rectangle + tail left much to be desired. I was upset I didn't order another large of the tajarin al ragu with Trout money.
5. Torta al cioccolato (2/5 Stars) $11: The table beside us ordered this dish, and it looked SO APPETIZING. Plus I was desperate to salvage the meal and end it on a high note. And while the dark chocolate cake with buttercream wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. It tasted like a chocolate cake. It wasn't moist inside, but it was rock hard either. Nothing made me want to eat more, and I ate it out of the immigrant mentality of no food wasted upon which I was raised.
I would come back for the beef ragu, but that is it. I will also say our server again wasn't rude or bad, but she also didn't enhance the overall experience. She seemed a little disinterested and went through the motions, and did not provide genuine, heartfelt hospitality. Of course, we aren't entitled to amazing service by any means, but when a restaurant does have that amazing hospitality, it adds so much to the experience.
TIP: For $105/person, Spinasse has a deal where the table shares every single appetizer, pasta, and main entree dish on the menu (slightly smaller portions but still a good deal)."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ellen C.","Wow, their pastas are really really delicious. The noodles are really thin which really brings out the flavor. Based on the yelp reviews, we ordered 2 half order pastas (the ragu and the butter/sage), a kale dish, and the onion stuffed with meat. Everything was delicious and between the 2 of us, we were absolutely stuffed.
I loved that they offered reservations for a Saturday evening at 6:30PM. I also did make the reservation about 1 month in advance. Parking was really easy since it was an early dinner, and was able to find street parking right next to this restaurant."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ivy L.","My friend loves this place and was absolutely adamant that we do our annual girl's holiday dinner here this year - so much so that even though the restaurant was booked, she called and left a message and was able to secure a reservation for us weeks in advance. I wasn't going to argue, I love pastas and homemade pastas are the absolute best! We had reservations during the holidays for a table of 5, and everything was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Parking wasn't horribly bad since it was on the outskirts of Capitol Hill, not in the mist of all the bars/restaurants/busy areas. We were able to find decent street parking quickly on a Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant itself is small and can be easily missed cause we definitely walked right passed it and had to turn around and walk back! It is a tiny little entrance right next to Altura, if you pass Altura by a lot, turn around! The is a double door leading to the interior to block out the wind, which is a nice touch. The interior is rustic and lightening makes it look like a candlelit tavern. The only complaint I had was the chairs - they were so so uncomfortable, it actually took away from my dining experience cause of how sunken the woven seats were and how erect the back was - please get new chairs!
Our server was quick and super friendly. We ordered a round of drinks, the Aperol Spritz was light and refreshing. We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 pastas, a main, and 2 sides to share between 5 girls and I thought the portions were definitely small. We were an ok full, but definitely not stuffed and could have maybe used a bit more food. The large pasta dishes were indeed on the smaller side, especially for the price. With that said, the pastas were good. We ordered the Agnolotti Dal Plin - little small pillows of delicious goodness. The tiny pillows were stuffed with such a flavorful concoction of meats and cheeses, beef and pork filled Agnolotti with a Double Brodo and Marjoram goodness to be excact. They were a burst of flavorful and the pasta was perfection (5/5). We also ordered the Tajarin con Burro e Salvia - basically a butter and sage pasta. Super simple but so much flavor. The tajarin pasta is Cascina Spinasse's signature dish - the super thin pasta is rare in most restaurants and Spinasse does it well. Lovely flavors of butter and sage, definitely the perfect ratio (5/5). And lastly, for the pastas, we ordered the Tajarin al Ragu. Again, an amazing ragu sauce with the right amount of cheese and the thin tajarin that just lets the sauce speak for itself. Delicious, albeit slightly on the salty side, just slightly. (5/5). My favorite dishes were indeed the pastas here - we also had two sides of kale and brussel sprouts - nothing to rave about there but a bit of greens to add to our carbo loading! The server recommended the Cipollini Ripiene - Roasted Cipollini Onions Stuffed with Beef and Pork Sausage with Toasted Pine Nuts and a side of bread as an appetizer and it was delicious! We had a friend who doesn't like onions but the mixture was cooked so well, you can't even taste the onions cause of the stuffed sausage. A good spread for the bread service (5/5). I also loved the amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, the butter and anchovies toast was the most delicious mix and I would never think to serve butter with anchovies on top. Yum yum yum! I wish we could've ordered this dish alone. And our last dish was the special of the night, Pork Belly with Potatoes. The pork belly was tender and flavored well, though it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. The restaurant definitely stands out cause of the pastas!
Overall, good experience and lots of delicious dishes. Pastas, amuse bouche and appetizers were all fantastic. The sides and pork belly fell a little short, though definitely not bad by any means. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the panna cotta - by far the best panna cotta we've had in a long time. The tiramisu was in a small jar and was just ok - I think the panna cotta just stole the show! Service was good, ambiance homey, but chairs need to be replaced for comfort!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jun Li Z.","Came here solo as I had always wanted to try this place out - it was in December. Sat at the bar and the waiters and waitresses alike were all friendly. There was one waiter - I forgot his name but he was super nice!
Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch! You get to see them cut the noodles and slice and dice it. They seemed like perfectionist and made sure all of them were equal in size!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sheryl K.","I want to start by saying that this is my most favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've tried many pasta places in the city, but Cascina Spinasse is my go-to. I even designated this spot to be my birthday dinner restaurant!
I am absolutely obsessed with their butter sage pasta. I don't know what it is about this dish, but it's so delicious. I could literally eat this every day.
I've had several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the butter sage pasta is what always stands out and what keeps me coming back. I don't think I've had anything that I didn't enjoy here. They also have amazing desserts. The last dessert I had was their tiramisu. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but I enjoyed theirs. It was so flavorful and delicious.
The only thing that bums me out about this place is that it's so popular and sometimes challenging to get a reservation in. Sometimes we go as early as possible to see if we can get bar seating. It's usually a hit or miss, but if they can fit us in, I'm generally down to wait for them to clear up some space.
If you're into delicious, freshly made pasta like me, you need to come here! But I highly recommend calling ahead to see if you can get a reservation. Otherwise, try getting there really early when they open for dinner to see if they can fit you in."

Would order again by deliciousness:
Agnolotti
Onion stuffed sausage
pasta tajarin el ragu
The egg with cheese fondue was a bit too heavy for us. We ordered tajarin butter and sage a few years back - it was way too salty. Not sure if it was just an off night.
Service was exceptional."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer O.","I made a reservation for Spinasse four months ago and due to conflicts that kept coming up, I had to bump the reservation twice. I was so excited to come here with my hubby for date night last night and must say kudos all around.
Food: we usually splurge when it comes to date night and spared no expense at Spinasse. We ordered two small pastas, two entrees, a side of veggies and two desserts. We ordered the butter sage tajarin and the the agnolotti. The portions were definitely small which was perfect for shareable dishes. The tajarin was rich and buttery and kind of had this melt in your mouth aspect to it. It was good but i would likely get the version with meat my next time around. I'm a gal who likes meat. Then came out entrees. Hubby got the beef cheek dish and I got the trout. I was dumbfounded when what looked like an entire fish arrived in front of me - skin , tail and all! I was expecting a filet and that was def not what I got. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all but was well seasoned and damn delicious when I got into it. Hubby loved his dish as well. I liked how the flavors of both of our dishes were complex but yet light at the same time of that makes any sense. It was a sophisticated delight to eat. We had sautéed kale with our meal and while it was good, it was honestly a little too salty. Then came dessert. Hubby got the apple tart and I got tiramisu. Both were BOMB. The tiramisu was rich and creamy, so good. Highly recommend both! We left extremely satisfied!
Service: the food at Spinasse is 4.75 stars but the service tips it to 5 easily. As mentioned, we had a reservation for 6:45pm on Friday night. We arrived at the restaurant at exactly 6:45p and was seated IMMEDIATELY. So many restaurants fall short of this gold standard unfortunately. In addition to be being seated promptly, we were also tended to frequently and the wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Atmosphere: small cozy classy restaurant but sans the 'tude. I can dig it. The restaurant is lively without being loud. Most patrons were on intimate dates and this is perfect spot for it.
Overall: excellent date night spot. Excellent food. Will return absolutely."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rio D.","Precaution: I'm very picky in general when it comes to food. I have very delicate pallet and I've traveled abroad a lot and gone to many restaurants. Especially when it comes to Italian, I tend to be a bit unfair because I'm used to Italian-Italian (lived there and visited many times.) So I should say maybe they are five but I just miss the authentic Italian. So four star. But everything else is good. Nice restaurant, service, menu, atmosphere, hip and trendy.

Get a reservation because seats are definitely hard to come by! If I were to recommend anything, the pastas are phenomenal. STICK WITH THESE. You cannot go wrong. Be blessed. Both tajarins are staples of the restaurant and are the only pastas that do not get changed on the menu.
1. Antipasto misto della casa: uva con gorgonzola (fresh grapes with Gorgonzola piccante, hazelnuts, chicories, and parmigiana-filo crisps), vitello tonnato (poached veal loin with tuna maionese, parsley, and fried capers), insalata di peperoni (roasted peppers with chickpea purée, boiled egg, and anchovies), and prosciutto di Parma (pio tosino 14-month aged prosciutto with fresh melon)
2. Tajarin al ragù: fine hand-cut egg pasta with pork and beef ragù

We made a reservation which was a good choice as our table was ready right when we arrived. I loved the warm, cozy Italian ambiance. We had the stuffed pearl onions (cipollini ripiene) as an appetizer which melted in our mouths with every bite. Then, we split the pasta dish tajarin al ragu, which was very rich and delicious, along with a side of the Zucca (I was skeptical of squash but it was very good and filling with yummy nuts and and Parmesan on top). Definitely a bit pricey but so wonderful for a special occasion or date night!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek B.","I had high expectations going into this, and I was not let down. I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thao N.","Finally got the pleasure to come here to try out their famous butter & sage pasta. One of those small, intimate settings with the dim lighting that I appreciate, but that means no photos for you guys;) The plates looked tiny, but is actually very filling so I recommend you getting a few of the half size pastas for more variety.
Going back to the butter & sage pasta, literally all my clients have been raving this so I've had it on my radar for a while now. I think they used actual angel hair because it was magical. It's one of those food porn moments, where it enters your mouth and might explode from all the bomb flavor.
Highly recommend coming here for any special occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, death of evil boss, or if you're a foodie like me and love exploring new places on a random Tuesday to avoid crowds, although this popular spot is busy all the time.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Spat S.","Top food and service. Sat at the bar on a Friday night, great atmosphere and could see the pasta being freshly made in the kitchen. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. Wines were amazing. Highly recommend the butter pasta staple, the ragu was also nice but didn't love it as much. Would definitely come back!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer Y.","Took an uber pool here - I suggest you do the same. Or walk? Seattle really isn't that stretched out the more you think about it.
Entrance is such a tease - what's behind those lovely white curtains? A magical place. Who knew that somewhere so cozy could exist on these cold rainy streets? There is one dining area (smaller) directly where you enter, then another (larger) adjacent to the left. The kitchen is visible through a glass windowpane where you can watch the pasta being made fresh and all the other happenings of the making of your food.
They're very friendly and understanding here. The moment you sit they ask you about any allergies or dietary restrictions. They're very clean - they clean every time they take away a plate. If you sit at the 'bar' - really it's just a nice view of the kitchen - they don't have hooks underneath the bar but they encourage you to hang coats on your seat or on their coat hanger hooks to the side.
Complimentary Crostinis
- Rabbit Liver Pate
Now I've never had pate so perhaps I'm just not cultured enough. But have you ever drank too much, then felt sick and thrown up? That after taste of thrown up alcohol is what this tasted like. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be overly rude, it's just exactly what this taste reminded me of.
- Butter and Anchovy
A lot of pepper. And a LOT of salt - tastes like extra salty fried fish. So, SO salty. Possibly too salty. But significantly better than the liver pate.
Tajarin con Burro e Salvia
Basically a very thinly sliced tagliatelle with butter and sage. This is a common combination but the first time I'd tried it. The sage didn't seem to mesh very well to me and the butter seemed almost like an aftertaste. The pasta however was undoubtedly fresh (not just because I'd seen them make it) but because it was so soft and rich. So soft it seemed like it should fall apart in your mouth but somehow still retained texture.
Carote Arrotiste
Huge, huge chunks of carrot. I wouldn't recommend getting this for one person because it could be a whole meal in and of itself. They were perfectly cooked but that's where the positives ended. Sweet then sour then various herb flavors - didn't seem like any of it meshed well together. The sour came through very, very strong."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rosa K.","I've been wanting to try out this place for so long and I finally got my chance! I came here on a Friday night (after 8pm) and I didn't make a reservation. I was hoping that since we got there around 8:30pm, we wouldn't have too long of a wait....they said the wait was 1.5 hours. SO DON'T FORGET- MAKE A RESERVATION! We weren't in a rush so we put our names down and go to the Italian restaurant next door to grab a drink and an appetizer (Artusi) while we waited (you can read my review for that separately :) )
We got the call around 9:45pm that our table was ready. We headed over there. I knew that I wanted to try the Tajarin but I couldn't decided if I wanted to go simple with the butter sage or the ragu. We decided to do BOTH. The pasta noodles were SO thin and just melted in my mouth.
Though the noodles were the same, the taste of the two dishes were so different. I did love the simplicity of the butter sage, but I felt that there was more flavor in the Tajarin al ragu (I love meat sauce). The butter sage had such a rich but delicate taste. The hint of sage elevated the pasta to feel elegant. The Tajarin al ragu is more of a homey taste. It has more ""umph"" from the tomatos and the meat which is right up my alley.
We got the smaller size of each of them and we were able to eat them both (even after our appetizer meal next door). The pasta noodles aren't as heavy and filling like ""normal"" pasta noodles which was a nice because I didn't feel as full or bloated.
The service was amazing, the waiter was so friendly- went through the menu, portion sizes and wine selection.
I definitely don't regret getting both the Tajarin dishes. I will definitely be back!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Owlburt L.","Went here last Saturday with the wife and our daughter for a belated birthday dinner. I had been excited and had high expectations based on the reviews. I booked this over a month ago and was hoping for a great experience.
Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed. The service was good but that is expected for a high end restaurant like this.
The food, however, was a major disappointment.
We started with the Uva Con Gorgonzola and the Cippollini Ripiene (both highly recommended by our waiter). The Uva Con Gorgonzola was an interesting dish most of which is I have never paid $15 for about 10 green and red grapes cut in half with 5 crumbled pieces of cheese and some hazelnuts. The balance just wasn't there for us. The grapes were sweet, the dressing has some zing to it and the cheese was just too salty. The Cippollini Ripiene wasn't too bad but it was again, overly salted.Unfortunately the ""overly salty"" theme was to be repeat itself to every dish we ordered afterwards.
And I am someone who usually puts extra salt on everything. Hell I even have slightly high blood pressure because of the amount of sodium I ingest.
We then ordered half orders the Tajarin al Ragu and Agnolotti dal plin and the Pancetta Ripiena. Although all the dishes were not badly made, the fact that all them were overly salty, ended up overpowering any ""complex"" flavoring that might have existed under it.
With drinks our bill came out to abut $180 plus gratuity. In the end was basically $100 per person (since our daughter didn't really eat anything), which is way overpriced for something that was nothing special and overly salty.
We won't be back and that's unfortunate since we really wanted to like this place. I am not a penny pincher when it come to eating out, I don't mind shelling out the money for good food, but why pay 4 times more for something you can get at places Il Nilo or Il Corvo that is much better."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dan C.","I was looking for a good place for an anniversary dinner, and just did a web search for good restaurants for special occasions in Seattle. Spinasse was maybe the third one that came up, but they had me at fresh made pasta. And oh my, the pasta...
But im skipping ahead. The restaurant itself is nondescript from the outside, sandwiched between a couple of other Capitol hill eateries. Inside is clean and close, with a rustic feel. Depending on where you sit, you can watch pasta being made in the kitchen... long sheets of beautiful, yellow, eggy pasta... I'm getting hungry again..
Service was prompt, friendly, and generally fantastic, with care given to cleaning the table between courses and being careful to not touch the silverware and plates as they were being replaced. We even got an extra candle and a couple of Happy Anniversaries! towards the end of our meal.
The food was even better. To start, we had a poached egg in cheese fondue and a savory shallot flan served over spinach and topped with fried shallots. Both were excellent, but I could eat that flan every day for a year.
Main courses were pasta in brown butter sage sauce, and prosciutto-stuffed pork belly. The pasta was, in a word, perfect. The stuffed pork belly was pork stuffed in more pork, with an herbed demi-glaze, and roasted potatoes. Awesome.
I finished up with an apple crostata, paired with an excellent grappa, and my Mrs. had the lemon curd and ricotta layered mousse.
I've had meals all over the world, and this was in my top 5 best meals so far. The ratings already reflect it, but this is a restaurant worth checking out more than once; we literally started planning our next meal there about halfway through this one."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathryn C.","I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!"
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elly S.","I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Monica K.","We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.
I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!"
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristin B.","April of this year when I went to Brunello. I had gnocchi with marinara sauce, which is one of my favorite dishes. It was delicious! I am all about sauce and this dish had it. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire."

The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mikala K.","My husband loved his salmon pasta with lemon butter, capers and white wine sauce $29. I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14. The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically."

After reading the reviews we decided to book the restaurant for my birthday when we arrived we were given the menus and were offered to taste some wine, which wasn't good. Then we ordered a more expensive bottle of wine from Brunneli's brand but the waiter decided to use the same glasses that he brought the wine to taste. When politely pointed to get us fresh glasses, his attitude was rather unpleasant. The food was very average. The lasagna was disappointing. The calamari were too chewy. The Fish stew was fine.

The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!

"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Felisa D.","I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back."

"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha G.","I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here."

It was very unimpressive. The buratta appetizer with lemon curd like topping was delicious. But it ended there. That should have been recommended as a dessert, not appetizer. The eat if the meal, pasta, was overpriced for what it tasted like and the amount.
The most odd thing which may sound great... But was awkward for me was we had three different servers take our appetizer order and hence we were confused what was really going to come and if we would get duplicates. It all worked out as we tried to be clear that another waiter had taken our order. But I found that burden and all the interruptions very uncomfortable.
Anyway, I was underwhelmed."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Peter C.","So so so much to like about Tavolata. Get the bread basket - it comes with this delicious spreadable cheese and balsamic vinegar. But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere. Anyway, just go and thank me later."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Camille W.","My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?"

We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy V.","Lovely environment. Romantic for dates and a great spot for happy hour - Pasta dishes running less than $15 that are filling! My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","This place gets busy very, very fast. We were able to sneak into the bar area for some dinner. Cocktails were good, but the mai tai was very fruity. Espresso martinis were espresso forward.
The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.
I would go back for happy hour and just order off that menu. 4 stars without the tagliatelle factored in."

If you happen to go for ddinner make sure to get some bubbly as well because they have a wonderful selection to pair with dinner."

Ricotta ravioli: The ravioli had the perfect amount of chew. The Sauce was nutty, zesty and sweet, perfect with ricotta cheese.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The handmade pasta was so good and the ragu sauce was just a little spicy and minty so not greasy at all."

Booked a table a month in advanced. When we arrived we waited a little while but was seated fairly quickly. We sat at a shared communal table. Food came out hot and tasted great. Hand made in house pasta was perfect. The pork chop was so big, perfectly cooked. We enjoyed the pork chop over the beef.
We will go back again but must allow time to find parking."

My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Kristen K.","My best friend in Seattle recommended this restaurant as his favorite Italian spot in the city, so we decided to make a reservation when a group of us were in the city.
It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.
Overall, really delicious Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill. Very nice space and excellent service. Definitely would recommend coming here to try some delicious pastas!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin Z.","Pretty run of the mill Italian fare. We had a large table come in for a birthday dinner. We ordered the rigatoni, papparadelle, tagliatelle, spaghetti and meatballs, hanger steak, and porchetta. The pastas were ultimately forgettable as the flavors and textures were decent but nothing special. Visually, the porchetta was stunning but came to our table very cold and had to be reheated. The dish ended up being disappointing because it was fairly one dimensional favor wise.
Overall, service was great but food left much to be desired."

From service to food, every experience I've had has been wonderful. The restaurant is very accommodating of big groups, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and careful with food allergies. The kitchen is on it! Food is fresh and delicious. Menu is fun and adventurous, and talk about that happy hour menu too.The atmosphere is trendy yet sophisticated.
Just go, you won't regret it, maybe make a reservation ahead of time. It's the little things, the attention to detail that add up into one great experience. I'm determined to try everything on their menu!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Cary H.","Trendy Italian restaurant with friendly, accommodating staff and well-dressed diners. The happy hour crowd brightens the room and it quiets down after 7.
We ordered almost half the menu and ate family style. Ingredients were of high quality and very fresh. The preparation was disappointing. Some entrees were were bland, and others were over seasoned. The branzino was overcooked into a dry mess. Also pasta was inconsistent, varying from hard/al-dente to mushy soft. Only standout was the perfect lamb-mousse bruschetta.
Yelp pictures and trendy menu are deceiving. Happy hour prices for a quick bite/cocktail is probably fine. But for fine Italian dining, Tavolàta is just not there. I have high hopes they can work on consistent preparation as those guys in the kitchen seem like they are really trying."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Ellen C.","This place is always consistent in terms of food and service. Came back during Seattle Restaurant Week ($35 for 3 courses). Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Robyn C.","You can't go wrong with their happy hour. I've had the spaghetti and chicken meatballs as well as the gnocchi.
Fresh pasta that's perfectly aldente with light and flavorful meatballs and a rich red sauce. The portion is pretty big too. I believe it was under $15.
The gnocchi is not you typical baby pillows. These are fluffy euro pillows tucked in a cute baby casserole dish- blanketed with sauce. The gooey cheese helps too!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Carmen V.","Great to remember Italian sounding restaurants you marked in your mental 'to try' list from a previous visit to Seattle. In this case, remembering the Tavolata name saved my night, as my colleague and I were literally fighting and almost grabbing each other's hair to go and have dinner together somewhere were we both could enjoy. My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.
Great quality food and very nice atmosphere. Looks like mostly customers were pretty girls in pairs (well, not talking for ourselves in this case) and some matc.com kind of couples just on a first date. Packed but fast and friendly service."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica L.","This is my favorite pasta place in Seattle! I heard so many great things about it for a few years but finally tried it this past March. The pasta is fresh and the sauces are delicious. Even though the wait was super long (about 90 min)on a Friday in August, it was honestly worth the wait.
One of my favorites was the spicy sauce pasta with octopus. The menu changes daily so make sure to check out their Instagram page before you head there."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phillip N.","Unique pastas everyday, high quality ingredients, delicious food!
Il Corvo deserves the hype it gets. I recommend checking their Instagram before you go to see what their daily pstas are, but if you're too lazy, their bolognese is always a solid go-to pasta. The pasta has a very nice bite to them and the meat is very savory and packs a heavy punch.
The line gets long but doesn't stay stagnant."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dione L.","If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here. The line and preparing to wait in a lie isn't just the hype. The hype is seriously real. Please get the salad and focaccia if you're going to wait the whole time. I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jason L.","I finally got around to dining here and I'm so glad I did! Since they're only open on the weekdays during lunch time, it makes dining here pretty inconvenient. Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy. All three were amazing but I probably enjoyed the torchiette the best since it was the cheesiest of them all. Don't get me wrong though, they were all great!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mia C.","For the price, portion, and quality of the pasta, iL Corvo is solid. However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Victoria C.","I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mandi W.","I stupidly came here at lunchtime... Whyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!
1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phil H.","Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca B.","I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathy M.","Our first day in Seattle as we were wandering around, we passed a long line of people waiting outside this tiny Italian restaurant. The weather was not great, so of course, I had to ask someone what was going on and WAS THIS LONG LINE WORTH THE WAIT.....I was told with an emphatic YES that this place was definitely worth a line and was given a brief summary of what to expect if we chose to try it out. We saved it for our last day on the hopes that a Monday might not be as busy as a Friday. Turns out, that this place is just busy! We arrived at 10:30 and took our place in line and our party of 8 walked out of this fine establishment at 12:40. Overall, everyone agreed that it was definitely worth the wait!! Their daily menu items are listed on a blackboard that you have more than enough time to read while you wait in line to order. In fact, because you are standing in line for the register in the middle of the 2 rows of tables, you also have ample opportunity to check out what the dishes look like as they are brought out to the other customers. This staff is amazing!!! They are friendly, efficient and seem to love where they work. No matter how improbable it seems, by the time you order and are looking for a place to sit, there is one available for you. Granted, everyone seems to understand that this is not the place to while away the hours and disregard all of the customers waiting in line.
Having said all of that, the food itself was wonderful. Fresh pastas, house focaccia and a kale salad that hubby has even mentioned to others because he feels it needs to be ordered (he is not a salad guy!). On our day, we sampled Pappardelle and Fusilli with rutabaga purée and loved both of them. I strongly believe that this kitchen knows what they are doing and you should trust their flavor combinations.
No matter how daunting the line looks, if you can make the time and are open to ordering what the chef has created, this place will not disappoint you!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rachel Z.","I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny W.","The line is worth it!!! Simple menu so they can focus on making their 3 pastas the bomb! If you're visiting Seattle, I would put this on a must visit list. Consider it one of their tourist attractions. You really can't go wrong with any of the 3 pastas they offer. Since they rotate their pasta choices periodically, order all 3 and share, in case the next time you're there, the one you didn't try is off the menu at the time of your visit."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lindsey S.","The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Johnny Y.","I've been here twice with the most recent time being in Nov 2019. While Il Corvo serves really unique and delicious pasta dishes, I was extremely disappointed the last time I went because of certain cleanliness issues.
Food: I've tried the pappardelle and the calamaretti. The pappardelle was delicious with a nice balance of flavor between the sauce and the pasta. The pasta was al dente and cooked to perfection. The calamaretti was a tad bit salty for me but it had a rich seafood flavor. I really liked that it came with calamari as a topping for the pasta. The bread and olive oil was really the star of this place. I really enjoyed the soft fluffy bread with the oil.
Service and Cleanliness: We came around 12:30 and waited 2 hours to be served, but we expected the wait. The issue arose when we found a piece of hair in the calamaretti pasta. We showed the staff and they immediately got us a new plate quickly. However, we found another long piece of hair in the Kale salad. I'm disappointed that it happened twice and I hope they have higher hygiene standards in the future.
Price: Really worth it.
Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan after the second time. I like the dishes and the seasonal pasta offerings, but finding hair in the food definitely made me lose my appetite."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","So the question is...Is it worth waiting in line in the rain for 30 minutes to get inside and wait another 20 minutes before you order? Yes! Small restaurant so you need to wait for tables to open before being seated but service is quick upon ordering. Menuu is limited to three lunch entrees. They always have the bolognese and two specials. $10.95 each. Pasta is homemade. Today was Lumache with celery root in a pepper cream sauce and Lasagna with chickpeas, kale and tomatoes in a bay cream sauce. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not overpowering and did taste like red pepper. I'm a fan of vegetarian lasagna and loved this one. The blend of vegetables with the cheese was extraordinary. And yes, it was rich. We also ordered sides of focaccia (good-not too oily and perfect for dipping in sauce), kale salad (not a fan of Kale Salad but the dressing made this dish) and a Dulce de Leche shortbread cookie as we needed something sweet to complete the meal Total tab with tip for two was just over $40. You'll walk out needing to go the gym and saying, I'm coming back!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Toni L.","Word. Waited in a 45 min line with my sister on a Monday morning (around 11:45am). The line moved quickly and there are plenty of hungry visitors that are right in the same boat with you. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is small and quaint, the line cuts through the middle and shared tables line the left and right sides of the restaurant.
You order everything at the counter and the chalkboard menu is revised daily, i heard. Dude taking the orders is super chill and patient despite the chaos of so many people bustling in and out. I saw many kale salads and a delicious looking caramel shortbread cookie on majority of the tables so we decided to get those. My sister also ordered the focaccia and then we each ordered our own pastas - i had a vegetarian one (sorry, forgot the name) and my sister ordered the bolognese pappardelle. Waters are self serve (there's wine available too) and then you are instructed on where to sit.
Love the homey, elbows touching, lively jazz vibes here. The food was absolutely worth the hype and wait. Pasta is perfectly firm and chewy and not to mention super affordable ($9.95 a plate). Sauces are simmered to perfection and i was blown away by the flavor on the kale salad as well as the rich intoxicating olive oil that came for dipping with the fresh baked crispy on the outside /fluffy on the inside focaccia.
Caramel cookie was also the perfect end to a hearty authentic Italian meal - shortbread was light and flaky and sandwiched in between was an amazing layer of soft caramel.
If you're on the fence i would 100% recommend giving it a shot. Also line seems to die down pretty dramatically around 2pm so if you don't mind a late lunch I'd say that's the way to go. PASTA FO LIFE"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tina Z.","We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer H.","If you're a pasta lover like me, you'll very much enjoy this little gem. Another fellow pasta lover brought me here and I was not disappointed.
There is always a line outside but it's there for a reason. It's the perfect lunch spot. I wish I could go every day just so that I don't miss a single dish they have to offer! Also love the fun antique decorations that gives the store so much character.
Their menu is updated daily with fresh ingredients. Unique handmade pasta with the most rich flavorful sauces! They also have other dishes besides pasta. I got their kale salad and it was delicious!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lihan C.","I think hands down my favorite place I went to in Seattle. There is a huge line for this place, but I thought it was worth it. I ordered the classic Bolognese and the Fiore that they had that day, as well as the focaccia. The focaccia was very soft and airy and the olive oil tastes super great. The bolognese is very hearty with meat and is very gritty, but very flavorful and tastes great. The fiore was HANDS DOWN my favorite. It was just a little bit tart and resembled something like a vodka/lemon sauce (although I think it was a different sauce the name escapes me now) it was very pretty and kind of a light orange in color.
The pasta here is perfectly cooked al dente. I was seated at the long table with a lot of other people just going there to enjoy the food and 2 other people took up my lead and also ordered 2 or all of the pastas offered that day. We made friends and everything was great. A lovely experience and I would definitely do the wait again since it was WORTH."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Vee V.","Yep, there's a wait, yep the focaccia is amazing.
I arrived 30 minutes before closing so they were selling out of a couple items, it must have been their flavorful items cause we ended up with their pappardelle alla bolognese and orecchiette with pesto, it was just okay.
Once you order they tell you where to sit if you're dining in, the pasta comes fairly quickly. You grab your own water, napkins, utensils, and bus your own table once you're done.
The bread, yes, they ish is herbaceous, soft with a crunchy crust, and perfectly enhanced by the dipping oil. This was our favorite bite of the meal. The pastas were cooked well, but the pappardelle was way over salted, it was almost inedible. The orecchiette didn't knock my socks off, it was fine.
Factoring in the wait, this isn't a place I must come back to."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer H.","HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Pasta Bella is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Its a small hole in the wall. The space is tiny and there's always a wait for a table but totally worth it. Not only does the decor feel so cozy and authentic but also the food.
I've been here multiple times for many events and it truly never disappoints. The bread that is served is so divine with the olive oil and balsamic. They also have olive oil roasted garlic you can ask for on the side. The Penn Cove mussels is a great appetizer.
Every single pasta I have tried has been delicious. My all time favorite is the Fettuccine Marsala Fungi!!! Ugh best pasta ever. Their noodles are made to order.. always made and cooked perfectly. Also the Six Layer lasagna is a must try.
My mom loves pasta and is pretty hard to impress with food - as she is a cook herself. I took her here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.
I would recommend making a reservation. Also make sure you get the deal on Yelp, $20 for $10!!"
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jensen M.","It seemed like this restaurant still felt like a work in progress though the food was promising. It's relatively close to our house and there was a yelp coupon so we thought we would give it a try. The location is not in the downtown Ballard which I think is a perk as parking was ample.
The pasta was good but the service was slow. A single server takes all the orders of the restaurant, everyone else has dedicated roles too. Everyone was nice and the pricing was fair."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sung S.","Food price was a bit pricy
Food itself was 3/5
The atmosphere is like going to someone home and felt a little crowded even though the place was pretty empty.
If the price was less expensive this would be a good place to eat.
Spaghetti was little watery
Halibut with pasta was good
Bruschetta was a bit overcooked where it was pretty much burnt but at least the flavor was good"

Service: 3/5 They seem a bit understaffed because the place wasn't even half full but it took about 15 minutes for a party of 2 to get seated even though it was past peak dinner time... Once we got seated, the waitresses were very friendly though and made sure we got our bread, water, and orders taken.
Ambiance: 4/5 2 main dining rooms with a bunch of Mona Lisa paintings and old pictures/paintings on the wall. It's a little dim inside and I'm not a big fan of the color scheme and decorations. Not the most visually appealing.
Parking: 4/5 Free parking in the lot next to the restaurant. Parking lot is a bit small, but there is also free parking on the surrounding streets.
Food: 5/5 I ordered the Penne Salsiccia Gorgonzola ($18) and my friend got the Linguini Carbonara with Sausage ($17 + $4). This is probably the best Italian place I have had so far in Seattle. Both pastas had amazing texture and the sauces were very tasty without being too heavy. Portions were also very big. The pancetta was a little salty, but that's ok. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian pasta. I will definitely be returning to try their other pastas. I have also heard the dessert is amazing. Prices are a little on the higher side, but the food is so good that it's definitely worth it!

We started with the gnocchi pomodoro and it was so fresh and the sauce was amazing. For my main dish, I had the Capellini Gamberi Alfredo and it was so so yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken risotto which he enjoyed. The portions were huge - we both took food home, which is surprising as normally when we go out my boyfriend finishes his meal and whatever is left of mine. Really great spot for a casual, but still amazing, dinner."

Luckily we made a reservation through the yelp app an hour prior because it's a smaller, cozy restaurant for sure. A handful of people waiting who didn't make reservations when we got there but they still got seated within 20 mins. Ordered a ton of food including mussel appetizers, two bottles of wine, fettuccine, lasagna, and much more. Everything was extremely yummy.
Our waitress was the sweetest and one of our dishes was taking longer to come out, so she gave us a complimentary dessert. Also amazing
Overall 5/5. Can't help that there's a wait for yummy restaurants, so make sure you make a reservation."

I went with my parents and we were able to order a good bit of food (super reasonably priced) to try.
Every dish tasted fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely did not skimp on the portion sizes as well.
We also got the calamari as an app (sautéed not fried) with olives and tomatoes - it was out of this world.

"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Zacarias D.","I decided to try out Pasta Bella for dinner on this Sunday night because I have driven past the restaurant a million times in Ballard and I'm glad I came to try it out.
The scenery of the restaurant is very old fashioned Italian feel. The hostess greets you with a wine menu. All of the pasta's and dishes are very authentic. I had a great spicy wine sauce linguine pasta and the noodles were Al dente! With my pasta I had a glass of Pinot Grigio that went perfect with the pasta.
For dessert I had the TiraMisu which was delicious chocolate had a coffee taste and was moist. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pasta. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniverary with your loved one or even just a date. I will be back for a special occasion"
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Viraj H.","Pasta Bella is a cute little italian restaurant in Ballard. It's a great alternative to the upscale italian restaurants you generally find, and has an old school charm to it.
The restaurant feels like you're walking into a house. They have two separate rooms/sections, both pretty identical. The decor isn't very fancy, but rather cozy and homely, and the ambiance is pretty quiet. Great low-key date place.
Though the place is pretty large, most of their tables seat four, so a large group may not be the best here.
The food was delicious. We tried four different pastas, and they were very good. I specially liked their raviolis.
We got a half bottle of wine, but surprisingly it was served in a carafe, not in a bottle. I wasn't very happy of how it was served, and would have preferred some clarity on that upfront.
The service, though mostly fine, seemed lacking in warmth. Our original server was very friendly and helpful, but the manager/owner? lady seemed very cold and rude. They kept switching servers on us, and the lady seemed annoyed with our requests for water refills. They forgot our soup (and didn't charge for it as well), which was pretty surprising, but not a big deal.
The prices are at par with the competition, sort of on the higher side for a comparable restaurant.
Overall, it's a cool place worth going to occasionally. Not my favorite italian restaurant, but not bad either. Would recommend!"

"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marco M.","This meal was a disaster. The food was about 3 stars but the service was so awful I'd give zero stars if possible.
My wife and I are on vacation in Seattle with another couple. They took us out the previous night so we wanted to treat them to a nice meal tonight. Since our last vacation together was in Rome I thought Italian food would be a good choice.
I made a reservation for 4 through Yelp and we arrived right at 7:30. We were greeted and seated promptly. A few minutes later our server brought water, warm bread and olive oil. So far, so good.
We ordered appetizers and entrees. We drank water, asked for refills as it was a hot day and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We asked for more bread. 45-60 minutes went by with no food. My wife asked the host and she explained that they were short staffed. She said to let her know if there was anything she could do. There seemed to be four tables occupied so it wasn't crowded but I think there was only one cook. It would have been nice if we had been warned there would be a very long wait for food BEFORE we were seated, or at the very least, before we ordered. We shouldn't have had to ask where our food was. Also, they could have offered complimentary drinks at that point.
The appetizers came soon after our inquiry. My wife and one guest enjoyed the shrimp pesto appetizer. We also had the special sun-dried tomato pistachio crostini. Two of us liked it, two did not. We also had the gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce which was ok. And I had the Caesar that was also just ok.
Then we waited. And waited and waited. The host cleared the appetizer dishes and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We explained that we were still waiting for our entrees. Perhaps she was embarrassed, who knows, but from that moment on she became rude and unpleasant - details to follow.
Our entrees finally arrived a full 90 minutes after we were seated. One guest and I split the puttanesca and a vegetarian version of the gnocchi. My wife and other guest shared Halibut with citrus sauce and linguini Amatriciana. All of the pasta was over cooked. The puttanesca sauce was fine. The gnocchi was ok. My wife liked the halibut but our friend didn't care for it. By the time the food arrived we were rather irritated.
The waiter said he would comp dessert and drinks. He cleared the table while my wife was still eating and even brought dessert menus before she had finished her meal. Only two of us wanted dessert and three coffees. They tried to get cappuccino or espresso but the waiter said the machine was broken. RIGHT. Then they asked for plain coffee. He said that since they closed at nine it was too late to make it. I pushed back saying it wasn't our fault that we waited an hour an a half to be served entrees. He acquiesced and brought out two decafs. The host brought out the two desserts and practically slammed them down on the table. Then the coffees and one tea arrived. She brought out a handful of little tiny portions of half and half and flung them onto the table. All of this with no eye contact or one word from her. After she left we had to laugh because her behavior was so ridiculous.
Then we waited and waited for the bill. We finally were getting up to leave to pay at the register when the bill came. At that point the host said some pleasantry as if she hadn't been awful for the past several interchanges.
I usually tip 20% or more on the entire bill but I only left $10 which was 10% of the pretax bill. In retrospect, I should have left nothing. The waiter wasn't rude, he just didn't let us know there would be serious issues in getting our food and then made a grand gesture of comping things he didn't have or wasn't willing to make.
Mediocre food and horrible service. We have another week in town and you can be sure we will not return here."

"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike V.","Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David P.","Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"

Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nicole A.","I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."

She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.

Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!

The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing!

There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lynden L.","My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Raquel M.","Nope. Terrible food and subpar service. My expectations were perhaps unreasonably high given the website's description of the chef's experience. The bread provided as a starter was neither fresh nor toasted. It had the distinct preservative flavor of poor quality bread. The pesto served with the bread was cold and reminiscent of the flavor of grocery store pesto. Our server was more interested in high dollar tables where cocktails were ordered and it was difficult to get his attention. I had the pesto di pomodori secchi alla puttanesca and the anchovy smell and flavor overpowered everything else. I typically can't get enough pasta but could not finish this dish. My husband had the manicotti al forno and while it was good the walnut flavor was overpowering. The price of our meal was not commensurate with its quality. We've had cheaper meals that were tastier and higher quality. I wish we had skipped this place."

"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda I.","I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."

The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christina T.","My boyfriend and I came here for date night and it has become our favorite ""hidden gem"" that turned into an anniversary tradition. We love pasta.
Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week.
Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce.
Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Annalise W.","Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex O.","Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Artemis L.","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex O.","Arancini Score: 3.5/5
Deep fried cheesy risotto served with light marinara sauce. Perfectly crispy. Has a nice crunch to it and has plenty of cheese pull!!! However, it was not very creamy and had a subtle taste. The added peas were a nice touch though
Gnocchi Score: 2.5/5
I was excited for this one but was let down. If you eat the gnocchi by itself the Gorgonzola cheese sauce is way too overpowering and goes straight to the nose. However, the flavor subsides when combined with walnuts.
Rigatoni Score 4/5
The pasta has a really nice bite to it. The sausage was on point and goes very well with the red peppers. I only wish that the red peppers were a lot smaller and not so daunting.
Lasagna Score 4.5/5
I have never had good home made lasagna and the best lasagna I have had is frozen. However, this knocks the frozen lasagna out of the park. It's a thin lasagna filled with a good balance of meat, cheese, and sauce. I especially like that the edges are nice and crispy.
Tiramisu Score 5/5
Omg this was so good. It was cool and refreshing. Filled with so much mascarpone cream. Coffee drenched lady fingers in between the layers and a chocolate top. I will get this again and devour it in less than 2 minutes. I gotta stop..."

My wife had the linguini and clams. I had their saltimbocca. We both had ceasar salads. I'd give the pasta 4 stars and the saltimbocca a 3.5 star. A red blend wine from Montepulciano was fantastic.

We made reservations day of using open table for a 5:45pm dinner. We were immediately greeted, checked in, and sat right away. We had a lovely table for two. This place is cozy and offers an intimate dining experience. I highly recommend this establishment for folks celebrating or just looking for a delicious authentic Italian dinner.
Food was top notch, after dinner coffee was a real treat, and the service was not a disappointment.

"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Toni Rose D.","My partner and I were craving pasta and we literally went to this restaurant because it was the closest to us. I'm glad we checked it out. We sat by the bar so that we could be seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty packed which is always a good sign. The bartender immediately served us with water. I ordered a glass of red blended wine to go with my pasta. I ended up ordering the pasta sampler with three different types of pasta: gnocchi, ravioli, and orecchiette. My partner ordered the rigatoni. The food came out right away. The serving for one pasta is a good size, but I thought that the sampler came in a smaller serving. The orecchiette was definitely my favorite although the other two weren't that bad. My partner loved the rigatoni. For dessert, we got the chocolate cheesecake and it was so rich. We were definitely stuffed. The service was on point!

"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jan M.","We were in town for a long weekend, and our normal place, Tulio, was closed for renovations....so we needed to find a new Italian place to eat dinner. After doing a bit of research, this place seemed to be ideal, as it has a few fish dishes, some vegetarian dishes and looked quaint and cozy from the pictures.
Upon arrival, we were seated immediately (as we did have reservations). First impression overall was good - this place was busy and bustling with energy. I was excited to see several specials for the night, and three of them were fish! The wine list was also very extensive with Italian wines from all regions. We asked for a recommendation from our waiter, and we went with it. He was spot on with the wine - it was fantastic!
We started with bruschetta, which was fresh and not too garlicky, just the way I like it. My partner had the minestrone soup and said it was fantastic. For entree's, he had a basic pasta puttanesca and I ended up ordering the baked eggplant, even though the specials looked amazing.
Food arrived quickly, and I will say, the flavors were overall very good, but the eggplant was a bit odd. Usually this is served with eggplant cutlets, but I found that there was mostly the skin of the eggplant with very little of the vegetable middle (the meaty part), so it was a bit tough and not that enjoyable. I think I was just unlucky, but this is the reason I gave this place 4 stars versus 5. My partner really enjoyed his pasta.
Would I come back? Yes, but I still prefer Tulio and will return there next time I am in town."

We had a bottle of a spicy Sicilian wine. Dammmmmnn good!
Service on point. Both times I dined here, was nothing less than perfect.
The vibe in this restaurant is lovely, welcoming, and warm. I was able to reserve a table for 4 on a Thursday night. The place was packed! Full of families, couples, and business people. This place is for everyone. Cannot go wrong here. Love you Assagio!!"
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Caitlen S.","Super unimpressed... went here for a date night on vacation with my boyfriend, after being given suggestion by the concierge and looking at yelp. The only thing that was worthwhile here was the oil for the bread! We asked for a second basket, that's an extra charge and it came literally after we had finished our meal. Our entrees came out SO fast they must have been microwaved, but one of our meals was barely warm! Lastly, we attempted to experience the highly recommended zeppole - not worth anyone's time or effort. Both the pastry and dipping were hardly considered good.
I had high expectations for this restaurant, and am truly disappointed it didn't satisfy. It also didn't help that a group sitting somewhat near us who were friends with the staff were literally yelling and laughing so loud I couldn't hear anything my partner was saying without having to repeat myself in a loud voice. Several groups around us were giving the table looks, as it was an obvious annoyance.
When it came time to use the bathroom, one of the two toilets was majorly clogged with lots of toilet paper, and the other had globs of wet toilet paper on the back portion of the toilet. Either way, it was undesirable to want to use and a rather easy thing to fix, something necessary in a busy restaurant to maintain.
The ambiance was clearly not fulfilled given the attempts. I would not return the next time I'm in Seattle."
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nathan S.","I couldn't find parking and had to park 4-5 blocks away, so I was already grumpy by the time I got to my table.
Our seating was fine (next to front window), but I noticed that the dining area is a very cramped, almost claustrophobic space.
Anyway, our party ordered drinks. I asked what beers they had on tap. The waiter listed them and then asked if I was local. Weird question, to which I replied, ""Yes, and I'll take the Fremont.""
The drinks were fine. My beer was good and somebody ordered a well-made White Russian.
When the waiter returned, we ordered some appetizers. This process was difficult because after asking for recommendations, our waiter tried to up-sell us on a $50.00 main dish, claiming that we could split it three ways and wouldn't lose our appetite. Then when we asked for another recommendation, he said, ""The gnocchi is good...""
At this point, I'm thinking to myself, ""Wtf is wrong with this guy...that's another main dish."" I decided to end this awkward interaction and blurted out, ""We'll take some bruschetta.""
So, off he goes with our appetizer orders: one member of our party had ordered some type of shrimp or prawn appetizer and another had ordered what looked like deep-fried green olives.
Shortly, the appetizers arrived, minus my bruschetta. It was also at this point that we decided on dinner.
I ordered their margherita pizza, somebody else ordered their fish, and another guy ordered some pasta.
Long story short, their margherita was one of the worst neopolitan style pizzas I have ever had. I took a few bites and refused to eat anymore.
I tried a little bit of the fish dish and it was good, but can't comment on the pasta.
After that, I desperately wanted to leave, but unfortunately other members of our party decided to order dessert: cannolis and lemon sorbet.
The sorbet was a frozen travesty and barely edible and the miniature cannolis looked like tiny unappetizing weiners.
The total cost of this abysmal experience came to $188.00....even without the forgotten bruschetta.
I won't be returning to Assaggio and recommend that consumers choose somewhere else to dine."
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tiffany G.","We tried this place recently when reservations for Lola next door were full. I made reservations a few days before, this was our first visit here. We started with the caprese salad and well what can I say, it was basil, tomatoes and mozzarella. Pretty basic and rather underwhelming for $12. We both had the pasta sampler and I have to say my combination was quite delicious. Gnocchi, penne with pancetta and oriettcheta with beechers cheese. I would definately order that again. We split a dessert, a lemon sorbet of sorts. It was tasty but rather basic again. Service was prompt and courteous. Cute ambiance, overall a decent dinner. I'm giving it 4 stars because not sure it was worth the price tag. I would still rather have gone to Lola next door given the option."

"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica G.","Super disappointing.
I took a new employee here (visiting from out of town) for dinner because of the good reviews, location, and ambience. Plus, I figured you can't really go wrong with Italian food, right?
WRONG! This place was disappointing on so many levels. I booked through Open Table, which actually went seamlessly. Got seated at a cute and quaint table right by the window, perfect for people watching. And then I noticed them...the fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. On the bread brought to the table. Floating around in the air. Lounging around on our table. Making themself at home on and in my wine. *shudders*
I spoke to the waitress and the hostess, and all they could say is that it was due to the cold weather. But, I eat out a lot this time of year and never experience this, and certainly not in a nice restaurant. I did get my glass of wine taken off the bill, but I could barely stomach eating my meal. I didn't see any fruit flies in my meal, but I'm sure had I let it sit there long enough, they would have made themselves right at home.
Sad. I love Italian food, and I was really hoping that this experience would be better and not so embarrassing for a new employee I had flown up for a work trip."

My boyfriend and I ordered the Gnocchi as well as the pasta tasting with Pappardelle and the Orechiette. My boyfriend loved the Gnocchi as he likes the strong flavor of Gorgonzola. It was a bit too strong of a flavor for me but I thought the other two pastas were very good. For $20, however, the portion size of the Gnocchi was extremely small. Another issue was the bread they served at the beginning was very cold. Not even room temp, but out of the fridge cold. We finished the meal with a tiramisu which was surprisingly pretty large! The dish itself was average-- nothing special really. Also, service was mediocre, the host wasn't super friendly and neither were servers. Overall, a pretty average experience."

"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca W.","This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!"

We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Kamara S.","Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Heather W.","Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Madison S.","This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."

"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","David H.","I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Elly L.","We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here."

We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!"

A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing."

This is a great place to take your out of town guests or your date. I ended up trying the rigatoni which had a lovely spicy kick to the dish. The pasta was made fresh and really elevated the whole dish to another level. The only dish I didn't care for is the bruschetta. It was made with this smoked salmon that came across as a tuna concoction that did not leave a taste to be desired. But I definitely would come back and try more from the menu since everything else was superb!"

Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area."

Service has always been excellent when I've been here. The place can get really loud. Lots of concrete for sound to reverberate.
During Seattle Restaurant Week, this is one of my favorites spots. Why? They just let you order off the regular menu while most other restaurants limit the choices."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Kelsey B.","HAPPY HOURRRRRRR!
But for real. Come for the HH. Daily from 5-7PM and it is literally the best deal in town. I am actually not sure why people come at 5PM and they choose not to sit in the bar area. Small plates ranging from $6-10 and the pastas are $11-12 instead of the regular priced $18-23. And they sure don't skimp on the portions - definitely super filing (I sometimes even have to bring 1/2 home). Plus some drink specials.
I love everything about this place, a super cozy vibe, you can see the open kitchen with the guys making fresh pasta; and in the summer there is a nice little patio out front for great people watching in Belltown.
Great service, amazing food, date night, girls night, friends in town go to Tavolata you won't be disappointed!"

We conveniently arrived during Happy Hour and ordered the Grand Central Baguette and the Bruschetta. I ordered the spaghetti for my entree. Everything was delicious. I especially enjoyed the marinated caciocavallo and the meatballs. They were extremely flavorful, and really hit the spot. If I am ever in Seattle again, I would definitely return."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","John W.","What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Danielle D.","TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Prag R.","Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Khanh N.","I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Nancy W.","I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."

fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Carol B.","Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny C.","It has been a long time since I've been here and on a Friday night there was about a 45 minute wait. The good thing about their waitlist is, if you miss your spot they'll put you in line for the next table so it is not like you have to wait all over again.
I don't really enjoy the atmosphere of this place and that's the main reason for me not coming back. It's crowded and loud and not in the least bit romantic if you're looking to come here for a date. That being said, I did enjoy the food. The Caesar salad had a good dressing and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I loved my linguine vongole and that was definitely the better of the two pasta dishes but I think I would be smart and just get takeout next time.
There is a 5% cash discount so bring some cash if you would like to save a little money."

"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Janhavi B.","My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Michael G.","Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Victoria H.","Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Nita L.","TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jenn N.","We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth K.","I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Pinky P.","This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Sou M.","My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Srikanth T.","Two things came to mind when I walked into this place. 1 - it smelled amazing. Maybe it's just bc the rest of cap hill smells like weed, but it was a welcome change of pace as far as smell goes. 2 - Machiavelli was the Italian you chose to go with? There were no other Italians that came to mind, you went with the guy who invented political scheming? I mean fine, I guess, but Ristorante Machiavelli reads like a name that some B level director would name the restaurant that the mob owns in his/her B level gangster movie. Anyways, I was waiting at the bar for 15 min and decided to grab the house red wine. The wine was decent but they poured it in this tiny ass cup, I felt like I was Kahwi Leonard palming a basketball drinking out of it. Surely you have real wine cups, Italian Restaurant. Anyways after we were seated we got served bread pretty quickly - rather than the usual olive oil and pepper to dip, they went with an olive oil and balsamic vinagrette combo, I was not a fan personally, it was more tangy than I would've liked. At this point you're reading this (wow, you're still reading this!) and wondering how I could possibly give this restaurant a 4. Well here's the good - the service was really good, the waitress was really friendly and the food came out super fast. I ordered the chicken Milanese and it was pretty decent. It was a little on the lemony side but the chicken was cooked well. I can't expect the same quality of New York Italian places but it was solid. The spaghetti wasn't perfectly al dente, but it also wasn't like barilla pasta. And it was only about 20 bones for an entree and a red wine. I wouldn't take an out of towner here, but it's not too bad.
3.5 star Sriview, truthfully it's a 3.5 not a 4, but I'll round up cause I do appreciate good fast service."

Never would have found this place if not for the recommendation of a bartender in downtown Seattle. Just goes to show you. Talk to your bartender. They know stuff.
It's in the Capital Hill area in a quaint little corner building with a homey comfortable feel. There is a small bar area in case there is a wait or you need a liquid appetizer. Wine list was adequate and plenty
Of cocktail and beer options.
I'm not sure if the bread was complimentary or if there was a cost but regardless it was completely necessary and appreciated. Half of the bread that I'm sure was a sourdough had green olives baked right in (see pic). And to gild the lily they offer a calamata olive tapenade with anchovies and mozzarella that will blow your mind. Salt on salt on love.
Chicken Piccata in a butter and caper sauce = 11 out of 10. Gnocchi al Sugo = same. Service = above and beyond. So good we didn't stop to take a pic.

"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Edward S.","This is a classic Italian restaurant like you might find in NYC, Chicago, or Boston (and they have been in Capitol Hill since 1988 which is very impressive).
I ate at the bar, which is small but has great service. I ordered a half carafe of the house red, which was really good for the price. They also give a basket of olive bread which is outstanding (they offer to sell second basket and I could see doing that if I were eating with another).
I originally ordered the lasagna, but since the bartender said it might take half an hour I switched to the Conchiglie della Casa (pasta shells with sausage and marinara). I was not disappointed with the switch. It was served really fast and was delicious. The pasta was nice and fresh, the sausage had just the right amount of spice, and the sauce was perfect.
I will definitely be back."

The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.

They do a build your own style ordering. You pick a sauce and a pasta
Got the mushroom and white truffle sauce with fettuccine. I kinda wish I got it with the recommended pasta or was a bit wavy and curled which held the sauce much better than flat fettuccine noodles BUT it was much more al dente than the fettuccine. And I like my pasta soft.
Added the sausage to it but it wasn't too much of a difference. The sauce was so flavorful didn't need the meat."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yash D.","Great fresh pasta and choice of sauces. It was pretty laid back on a Friday night. Lots of vegetarian options. Don't forget to:
1. Clean up after you leave.
2. Order bread with your pasta dish."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cristina G.","I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."

- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"

----
Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!
----
My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?"

I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."

Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."

I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brianna F.","We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stanley T.","Absolutely wonderful. I am so glad I came here on my Seattle trip.
FOOD
The pasta was absolutely DELICIOUS and made FRESH. My friends and I ordered 3 pasta bowls. I don't remember the pasta noodles itself but I remember ordering the Traditional Bolognese, Kale Pesto, and Mushroom & White Truffle Oil. Let me just say, the Mushroom & White Truffle was splendid and this is coming from a person that HATES mushrooms. The truffle oil wasn't overbearing and the shiitake mushrooms was an excellent compliment to the overall dish due to the umami flavor. The Bolognese came second, it was decadent but not too heavy. The Kale Pesto came in last, it was good but not my cup of tea. It had a very earthy flavor that some of you may like.
SERVICE
Exceptional service. The two girls that were working on 1/18/2020 around 7pm were extremely delightful. I loved their recommendations of which pasta went with which sauce.
RESTAURANT
Cool garden wall. Seating may be limited depending on the time. We went during dinner and it was a struggle finding seating but we eventually found seats.
CLEANLINESS
Clean. Seattle has a thing were you take the plates and utensils to the cart yourself.
PARKING
There is street parking but I walked to the restaurant."

Ordered 3 pasta dishes (Bolognese, mushroom truffle, Amatriciana). They were all amazing, and we found ourselves sad when we realized we ate our dinner too quickly. Definitely would recommend if you have a pasta craving."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Melody Y.","Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mohit N.","Went with a friend for dinner and ordered the Kale Pesto pasta and the Bean Ragout as our vegetarian options. I had never had beans with pasta before, but this place somehow made it work really well. The Kale Pesto, however, was definitely our favorite. Can't wait to try the mushroom & white truffle oil pasta next time!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jen L.","My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."

"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Visesha K.","Surprisingly, out of everything we ate on our short trip to Seattle, this was one of the best. I really enjoyed how you could choose your own sauce and type of pasta, which is made fresh in front of your very eyes. I also liked that the sauces had a lot of vegetarian options, and there was overall a lot of good variety. The only downside is that you do have to go pick up your food from the back when it's ready and bus your tables at the end, so if you are looking for a fancy, sit-down restaurant, this is not the place. However, as a couple looking for an affordable Italian restaurant, this was the perfect spot for dinner."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sachi E.","I'm not a huge restaurant pasta eater because I'd rather make my own at home. My friend flew from NY to visit and wanted to try this place, so we went. It's open seating so be prepared to sit with strangers and bus your own table. The service was one of the worst I've had - very short, condescending when I asked about the pasta and when I asked for a side of sausage was told ""no"" with an attitude. The actual pasta was tasty, but nothing outstanding or special. Will not be back to this place and wouldn't recommend this place over any other pasta place in Seattle."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","chara c.","Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Hannah D.","We had this on our list of places to go when we have a babysitter and finally got to go! We were pretty dressed up because it looked nice in photos. Most people there were very casual and had just got done shopping. Several families had little kids. I realize now that we could've just brought ours! Oh well!
I had the modern love cocktail to start. It had a super herby and interesting taste with an orchid on top. Very pretty for photos! But let's be honest, the whole restaurant is photo worthy and I'm a huge sucker for aesthetics. For dinner I had the rigatoni and it was a very generous portion. I could've probably saved half for a second dinner! It was amazing, like all Ethan Stowell food. My husband got the hanger steak and it was a VERY small portion, about 5 bites of steak with fries. He said it was very good, but not worth the $35 price tag. Can't wait to go back!"
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Allison T.","Service: To start off, we made a reservation ahead of time through Yelp, but when we arrived ON TIME they said they had no record of our reservation. It wasn't a huge problem, though, because we were a party of two and they had plenty of seating open. We were seated at about 7:35pm and ordered at 7:45pm. We only ordered one appetizer and two entrees--the appetizer arrived about five minutes after ordering, but we did not receive the entrees for another 40 minutes. For a restaurant that was probably only about 40% occupied, it felt like an excessive wait. Also not sure if this was significant or not, but one thing we noticed is that each time someone came to take our order/check in on us, it was a different person each time.
Food: The food was actually pretty good. We got the focaccia for appetizer, and the gnocchi and the rigatoni.
Ambiance: Simple and elegant.
In fairness, I would give 3.5 stars, but the wait time for two pastas was actually pretty ridiculous. Even with the good food, I probably won't be back."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Scott S.","Cortina was a solid Italian establishment with a bit of an upscale vibe. It's in the ground floor of an office building, you can probably imagine exactly what it looks like.
We went as a group of 6 and shared a lot of appetizers such as squash and crostini. Then for dinner had a meat sauce pasta and a chicken dish. Both were pretty good.
Service was good as well. Solid restaurant if you're in the area, nothing I'd go too far out of my way for."

We had a group of 10 and we made a reservation and were seated quickly! The ambience in here is very nice. It's dim but not too dark. The interior was simple with lots of tan wood. I had a lot of fun here, maybe it was the company, but the waiters/staff were super respectful and really just let us socialize while making sure our water cups were full.
The food here is really delicious. I'm really glad we went with a pasta/italian place. I ordered the linguini nero but EVERYTHING looks amazing. My second choice would have been the carbonara. It looked so delicious. The linguini was black noodles with lobster. It was slightly spicy but it complimented so well with the dish. I really enjoyed the pasta. I would absolutely recommend the linguini nero. Not only did it look really unique and cool, it tasted unique and yummy!
I'd recommend this place to everyone! I came with no expectations and left really happy."

Beef tartare was excellent and the fish brushceta has a strong smokey delicious flavor. Fast responsive service. Clean modern decor. Very comfortable upscale atmosphere. Regular menu is more expensive but food is definitely worth it."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Sophia K.","I came here on my anniversary weekend with my boyfriend because I was craving pasta. The appetizers here looked sooooo good and the dining atmosphere looked very modern and simple -- both wins in my book.
Upon arriving, the reservation I made through yelp fell through but fortunately we were able to get seated right away. My bf and I ordered a TON of things, our server (who was super nice and friendly) even joked around thinking we couldn't finish. If I remember correctly, we ordered the bruschetta, beef tartare, fries, and two pastas and drinks. The wrong bruschetta came out so we actually had two at our table. While I can say the appetizers were absolutely amazing, the pasta as okay at best. At the time, I considered coming back just for the appetizers.
Now why do I give my experience three stars? I woke up at 5am the next morning with food poisoning and again 3 hours later throwing up everything I had in my stomach. I've never had food poisoning before so it was absolutely brutal. Suffice it to say, my boyfriend ate all the same things I did and he was totally fine. The only difference was that I ate the carbonara and he had the rigatoni.
Although having a shitty experience afterward (literally), I would recommend this restaurant to others but not entirely sure I would come back."

It's funny that @cortina was never in my list and I just tried it by coincidence. And I'm IN LOVE . Due' Cucina was used to be my top choice but now I must say that @cortina is the best!!!

I tried Bucatini (plenty of meatballs), Rigatoni ( my most favorite ), Linguine Nero (with Dungeness crab). All of them were super delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, al dente pasta and good portion . I would loveee to come back again!

TIPS: the Linguine Nero is delicious but it tastes a little more sour compared to other pastas so you should try to eat this first before other dishes for the best taste!

Their menu is short which I really like. The food is really good as well. I went with a large group and was able to get reservations for Friday night easily. They don't have parking but you can always find street parking close by. I got to try their linguine Nero, gnocchi and my husband got their burger. For appetizers we got their focaccia, white bean bruschetta and their fries. The appetizers were decent. Fires were a little over seasoned and the focaccia would have been better if it was warm. Loved their bruschetta though, many textures and flavors. Their gnocchi was delicious, creamy, pillowy and cheesy. Most of our group got this and really liked it. I got their linguine Nero and really liked it. It's just a tad too sour. I think the peppers is what makes it so, if I knew I would have got mine without the peppers. The crab and the pasta itself is delicious though! My husband loved his burger. Perfect cook, perfect flavor.
The drinks are unique. They do serve usual versions of the drinks if you ask though. I tried their grapefruit mule. It's a little bitter, but if that's your thing you would love it. Service is on point! Our server was really helpful and patient. Would go back to try more!"

We are then escorted to the back of the restaurant and seated at a lounge table with slouchy chairs because ""this is what wE have available"". Really?

I came here on a Friday night and did not need a reservation to sit at one of the tables near the bar. There weren't many people dining there, so the atmosphere was kind of quiet.
I had the bucatini and enjoyed it. It came with plenty of meatballs that I thought were just a tad dry, but the pasta was delightful. I was full by the end of the meal, so the portion size was acceptable by my standards. I paid around $30 including tax and tip, which is not too bad for a plate of fresh pasta."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica C.","Happened upon here during restaurant week which means they limit their menu. However, their food is great. Partner got the bacon burger and loved it. He never accepts bacon in his burger but they did their so fantastically crispy, he let it slide. Also even though he ordered well done patty, it was still juicy. Less so from the meat and more so from the amazing flavors, like the special sauce and thinly sliced tomatoes.
I got the prosciutto as an appetizer with the carbonara pasta. The prosciutto was super soft with a cheese shaving on top. Would have liked a bit more cheese but it's OK. The pasta came with the yolk intact, allowing me to pierce it and spread across the fresh noodles."

"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Emily J.","I love noodles. This place had been on my bookmarks for a long time. I am not always in downtown Seattle where it would make visiting this place convenient but luckily this past week, I was. Plus my friend said it was one of the noodle places he really likes.
We walked in around 7pm on a Thursday night. Most tables were full, people before us had reservations, a few people in the waiting area, but lucky us, we got a table.
First things first, we ordered drinks. I ordered the Blackberry Margarita. It was refreshing and very appealing to the instagrammer eye. I wouldn't say you could easily tell there was alcohol in it but it was very tasty and easy to drink down quickly.
For food, I could not decide between the Uni Butter Spaghetti or the Carbonara. I asked the waiter for his recommendation and he said definitely the Carbonara with no hesitation. That made my indecisiveness go away and easily choose the Carbonara. My friend ordered the Uni Butter Spaghetti so I still ended up getting to try that as well. Both of those pastas were super good.
You may think it is crazy but we also ended up ordering an extra pasta dish to share. It was the Bucatini. Consider it normal since we did not get an appetizer. Normally I am a fan of anything Bucatini and the pasta was good but the sauce wasn't really anything special and the meatballs were try and kinda flavorless.
3/4 of the dishes being very good would still be considered a successful dinner in my opinion. I really wanted to try the Linguine Nero but the reviews made it sound like I would be disappointed so maybe another time.
If you are reading for the menu on their website, know it changes. Some of the pastas stay the same but they change some in and out. 10/10 would go here again."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Edward S.","Cortina is the latest restaurant from Ethan Stowell and I was glad to find it lived up to the standards of his other restaurants. It is a pretty large space and is nice and bright.
This is an Italian restaurant with a great menu. Service was superb--our server Elmelia was terrific. I started with the Buffalo mozzarella and the Brussels sprouts. The mozzarella dish was heavenly--the cheese tasted wonderful and was complemented beautifully with some sliced ham and pistachios (along with a few pieces of bread). The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly.
Next I had the parma pizza. The crust was a little soggy, but the toppings were excellent, particularly the prosciutto. It comes with a generous amount of arugula.
The last dish was my favorite--the fontina ravioli. The fresh pasta was great, but the cheese and truffle flavor was absolutely exquisite. This is a really good dish."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Brittany I.","Finally got to try this newer Ethan Stowell restaurant. It was fairly easy to make a reservation here for a large party during a week night, even the night before, which was great.
Overall, our dining experience, from service to food to ambiance, was very solid but nothing super stand out.
As for food, we tried a bunch of items but my favorites were the Prosciutto di Parma (SO smooth!) and Gnocchi al Telefonica (has a bit of a kick!). The Linguine Nero was a disappointment unfortunately. I was optimistic after reading reviews but after eating it, the flavor was really one-dimensional and lacking for me. There was also maybe only 2 small pieces of lobster. The breadcrumbs gave it a nice texture though.
My colleague had the Tonarelli Carbonara, which was good but not your traditional carbonara. This version is actually a bit lighter and less rich than most carbonaras I've eaten. Sometimes they are so rich you can't eat much. That isn't the case here. However, the pasta is thicker so that will fill you up quickly!"
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Meagan W.","Honestly the food was really good, but due to the service I don't think I'd come again.
For a nice restaurant we were pretty disappointed with service. We made the mistake of saying ""no"" when asked if we had a show to get to- and proceeded to sit for 45 minutes waiting for our food while two other tables beside us sat down, and received two courses in the time we waited for one. We had a reservation and we weren't in a rush, but a 2 hour meal when everyone else was in and out in under an hour was disappointing. We are fairly certain our order got pushed behind EVERYONE going to a show- one or two in a rush wouldn't have been a big deal, but that was a really long time! Also, no one even noticed it had been that long- not even a ""sorry for the bit of a wait"".
But the food was good! We got the burratta, bruschetta, and ravioli and al were really tasty! I'd say average to smal portion size which is fine because they're all pretty rich food I'm not sure I could have eaten more of it (or I was full on water from my free time, you decide).
All in all, maybe it was our server, maybe it was an extra busy night? Not sure but I likely wouldn't be back or recommend to a friend based on our experience."

Our server, Tom, went above and beyond; he was incredibly friendly and checked on us a few times. When I booked a reservation I notified Cortina that it was our anniversary and they gave us a surprise of two glasses of champagne at the end of our meal! We had three dishes: funghi pizza, potato gnocchi, and the special of the day which was king crab spaghetti.
Both the pizza and the gnocchi were great 4/5 stars. Everything was so filling my boyfriend and I felt like the both of us would've been full off of one of the three dishes if we shared it.
My only complaint is that the king crab pasta was super sour. It was unpleasant to eat and the white wine drowned out any potential flavour. It's a 1/5."

The ambience is dark with some overhead chandeliers with dim light bulbs. The music is loud and more of dance style/fast beat so it was a bit odd. Maybe the music is to get people to eat faster. We were at the bar as it was packed. They don't take reservations so I don't recommend coming as a large group. Maybe max 4 people in a group.
The food was good. We ordered the octopus salad, gnocchi and beef tenderloin steak. The octopus was good, had a nice charcoal taste with a little spice. It wasn't chewy or overcooked. The gnocchi was super soft that you didn't really need to use a knife to cut in half. Our gnocchi dish seemed smaller than what other people had posted before. The tenderloin was supposed to be medium rare but seemed more medium. It was still tender and the sauce tasted like a red wine reduction.

Total score, and the food is amazing. The gnocchi is the best dish ever.. if I could eat it every day for the rest of my life, i would die happy.
As echoed in some of the other reviews, the wait can be pretty frustrating. They might say it will be a 20 minute wait, but then it will end up being close to an hour. It's usually quicker to get a bar seat.
Most people who come here return several times after because the food is so good, and it's a special experience."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David B.","Review based on a great tapas type bar visit.
We sampled a whole bunch and came away impressed all the way.
Cocktails were righteously made. Wine pours generous.
Arugula salad near perfect. Meatballs delicious.
Gnocchi right on target. Shrimp great.
The only downer was the choice of tomatoes for the heirloom salad. They were tired and mealy. Based on the rest it was just an oversight.
Looking forward to the next few visits."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dominic D.","After reading endless positive reviews and seeing a 4.5/5 rating, I was super exited to grab food here on date night. We dropped in on a Wednesday for happy hour food/drinks (6pm). Loved the prices, but admittedly didn't love the food.
First, I will comment that prices are exceptionally good during happy hour. Also, their happy hour stretches a bit longer than most. From a food perspective, I wasn't in love with most dishes. Octopus salad smelled slightly fishy (possibly fish sauce?), and could have been grilled a little longer for my liking. Ahi tuna needed more flavour--salt or brine (miso/soy) would make this much better. Baked broccoli wasn't really baked, or not to our expectations (ie. crispy, crunchy). Gnocci with black truffle was my favourite. Lots of truffle flavour. Definite recommend. The clams in broth also lacked good flavour.
Ambiance is interesting. Dark romantic lighting, but music reminded me of a dinner club. More upbeat/dance."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ruth C.","The happy hour here is incredible: half off items on the food list, beer for $4.50, and wine for $5.50. The handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream is to DIE for! It has the perfect texture and the creamy sauce is so delectable. Additionally, the baked broccoli is perfectly crispy and seasoned, and honestly is a thousand times better than Black Bottle's blasted broccoli (which everyone seems to love). List's baked broccoli is the broccoli dish you *should* be raving about.
My husband tried the grilled chilean sea bass and the lamb and beef burger with potatoes. He enjoyed both and would also give List a 5-star rating.
I love the lighting and atmosphere. It's small, cozy, and intimate. The dim lighting makes for a romantic date night, but it doesn't feel uppity at all, so you could totally still come here for a bite with friends.
Staff and service are great. Be sure to have your ID ready at the door, as you have to be 21+ to dine here.
Overall, highly recommend! A gem in Belltown."

We were wandering around Seattle downtown at night and had already had a very poor and expensive experience at a renowned restaurant down the road. Came across this gem and it did not disappoint. The drinks were fabulous. The food was tapas style and we dove into plate after plate to try an arrangement of different meats and seafood.

- AMBIANCE: dark and loud club lounge music (can't hear your own thoughts) and IKEA PLATES!!! And a mix of other plates too but wow haha.
- PRICE: half off was great before 6:30, but tbh I think it's the optimistic side of the fair value of the food (most items $11-18 at full price, portions more like tapas) $25pp after discount which wasn't bad but wasn't edible
- FOOD: I couldn't eat more than a bite of most items, didn't like :(
TLDR: friendly service, nay to the loudness and not good food. will not be back :(

- flatbread $12, GOOD: the only thing I'd get again. Chewy flatbread and cranberries. Love feta
- tomato salad $11, PASS: 3 tomatoes, and a tofu looking stick of cheese
- baked broccoli $10, PASS: broccoli soaked in evoo and garlic, nothing you can't make at home
- chicken $14, Yish: can't even see it below the bizarre Marsala looking sauce and mushrooms. Sauce was like a fusion sweet and sour? With pounded and likely floured chicken? Not a fan

I have been here once two years back but I didn't remember what I ate. Only remembered that I had loved the food. But the lines always scared me away. Decided to make the trip from Bothell during winter break so we came here on a Thursday at 9 pm for their happy hour. They still had a few tables open and we were seated immediately. You gotta love the happy hour deals here. All food items except featured ones are half off, the house red and white by glass is 5.50 $, by bottle is 19$ and draft beer is 4.50$ per glass. If I lived close by I would be a regular here.
The food is just fantastic. I loved their flavors! Everything is on point and the seasoning is phenomenal. We tried their gnocchi with truffle oil, sea bass grilled, clams is white wine sauce and crostini, octopus salad, chicken in mushroom sauce and their chocolate tortino dessert. Everything was amazing would recommend all! Specially highly recommend their gnocchi, it's the best I've had so far. The hype is real. We loved it so much that we ended up getting one more plate. The flavors were bang on across the board. Plus all of this at half price off!! The dessert was a moist chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato. If I have to nit pick, I think the sea bass was a bit overcooked, clams were a little sandy and although the flavor of the gelato was awesome, I found it a little icy. But no major negatives! The service is good, nothing much to say there. Our server was nice, she did her job, nothing more nothing less.
After one drink each, 6 food items and one dessert we paid 77$ before tip between 3 people! Don't miss this place, specially in their happy hour and they have it everyday. I can't believe it look me 2 years to go back. I won't be waiting that long before my next visit!!"

We order 5 plates: Calamari, Octopus Salad, Canneloni, Clams, and Bacon-wrapped Prawns. I was dying to try the Gnocci but they had sold out for the night. It's just another excuse to come back, and we will definitely be back. Everything we tried was cooked so well, and extremely flavorful. My favorite dish was the Octopus Salad.

"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carol L.","I really wanted to love List because of how much these reviews raved about the food and the service. But I honestly can't.
I was originally told to wait 45 minutes for my party of 4...but ended up waiting 2.5+ hours. The worst part was that the server was constantly letting smaller groups cut in front of us. As a result, 6 groups who came after us were seated even though we were 1st on the waiting list. I honestly wouldn't have minded the wait, but it's just more frustrating to hear from servers that our table will be ""ready soon"" and then turn to see someone who JUST walked in the door get seated.
The saving grace of this place was definitely the food. It's why I give this place 2 stars instead of 1. We ordered the broccoli, grilled octopus salad, spicy meatballs, handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream, bacon-wrapped wild gulf prawns, and grilled Chilean sea bass. Everything tasted pretty good and I recommend all the dishes above except the broccoli. I think you can make the broccoli at home and it's nothing really special. If you can, go during their happy hour since their dishes are discounted."

We also shared a bottle of a white wine (forgot what it was called! but I think it was the only option for that happy hour period). It was busy inside around the happy hour time that we came at, but we were seated somewhat quickly at the bar area that was directly next to the doorway (not ideal, but we just wanted to be seated). We were provided with water, and not soon after, we were asked if we wanted to move to the table out in the patio, which was perfect!
The food was delicious and good quality, especially paired with the wine, and service was excellent. Our waitress checked in on us frequently, but not too frequently, and we had a good time overall. My only warning to future patrons is that while the patio seating is really bright and lovely compared to the dark (and noisy) inside, it does get a bit dusty sometimes and you might find some dusty particles in your beverages lol!"

We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.

Forest floor frenzy as well as the chicken main course we're delicious. Service was great! The servers were very cheerful and gave some nice recommendations and answered our questions.

I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better."

Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!
I've read other reviews complaining about the wait time, but I went on a Tuesday evening so I did not face this issue. Definitely a fantasic choice for your dose of Italian, Romance and crazy! Ill be back for sure."
"Bizzarro Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bizzarro-italian-cafe-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Stacey P.","Full disclosure - I came here after a full day of drinking at the Scotch and Beer Festival followed by a couple hours at a bar. What I'm saying is this is my perception drunk.
My friends really wanted to take me and another friend here and I'll admit I was a little hesitant. The word ""Bizarro"" filled my head with a clown and circus theme, for some reason (drunk), and I didn't want to deal with clowns. There were no clowns.
I recall there being a wait but we stood outside where there was plenty of room to talk and it was nice. There wasn't any room inside to wait. Once inside they seated us in the back corner. I didn't feel too crowded and took in the assortment of stuff that was everywhere. While no rhyme or reason seemed to be had it reminded me of having dinner in one of those antique stores you find in a small town surrounded by stuff in every direction.
The bread was good - thick and chewy. The olive oil was ok, the balsamic vinegar was on the spot. Their lasagna was unremarkable to me. It was noodly goodness with heavy marinara and...I don't recall the cheese. I mean, I'm sure there was cheese because lasagna has cheese but it didn't pierce my drunken haze. My friend had this bolognese dish that was delightful - salty, flavorful, great noodles, fantastic meat. I recall taking full advantage of her permitting me to eat it and then giving my leftover lasagna for them to take home.
The service was utilitarian. They weren't overly talkative, friendly, or engaging. We came in late and I imagine they were tired. It seemed like lots of different people came to drop off and pick up dishes. Our waitress became a little cross with us as I wasn't the only one inebriated and our slow pace at ordering combined with not being as specific as she needed made her irritated. I can't blame her.
We all Ubered home after. It was nice, different, and a change of pace."
"Bizzarro Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bizzarro-italian-cafe-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Chong H.","Best chicken Marsala this side of the Mississippi!"
"Bizzarro Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bizzarro-italian-cafe-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Samantha O.","We had someone recommend this place to us, and overall I did enjoy this restaurant. I probably wouldn't hurry to return, but if I really wanted Italian food (not generally my favorite cuisine so this doesn't happen often) then I'd come back. We came here at about 7:30 pm on a Sunday evening, and the two of us were seated right away. The service was a little slow at first but it did pick up after we placed our entree orders. There was a bit of a mix up with our appetizer order, but we ended up enjoying the arancini (the one that was accidentally brought to us- we were not charged for this) FAR more than the bruschetta we ordered.
Just to get this over with: their version of bruschetta was honestly one of the worst things I've ever eaten. This sounds like I'm being dramatic, I know, but goodness what an odd flavor combination. I would not call myself picky and I'm able to eat pretty much anything people put on my plate, but this... was a no-go for me. We both felt bad about the mix up so we tried to force ourselves to eat more of the bruschetta but it was just so bad that I couldn't. Weird flavors, way, WAY too sweet for an appetizer. The only positive part of this dish was the bread it was on, but it was ruined by the sickly sweet reduction and the horrendous gorgonzola. People on yelp seem to really enjoy it, but I'm just here to tell you- it won't be for everyone. It's unfortunate because I feel like they could do a classic savory bruschetta beautifully, but I understand wanting to do something more unique, I guess.
The arancini was quite good, on the other hand. This was the appetizer that was mistakenly served to us (just to be clear, we pointed this out to our waiter and he asked if we just wanted to keep it- we didn't just dive in). Honestly, even though we felt bad about the mix up, we were glad it happened because of the whole bruschetta situation. This made up for the bruschetta. Our waiter described them as fried balls of risotto with fontina cheese and saffron. The marinara it was served on had a lovely, light smokey flavor. I'd order this one again.
The complimentary focaccia comes with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in. Every aspect of this was delicious. The olive oil tasted amazing. You could even do without an appetizer if you wanted to because of this amazing bread.
For my entree I chose the Sicilian pesto, which was in the seasonal section of the menu. At first I wasn't too impressed flavor wise, but then when I mixed the dish up a bit more the flavors were dispersed much more evenly. I ate the leftovers the next day and it was better after the flavors melded together more. Probably wouldn't order this one again due to how dull it was despite the exciting description. The entrees come with a starter salad, but you can substitute for another type of salad or soup for $4. I got the caesar salad. I loved it. It was beautiful- and they put anchovies on it which I personally enjoy. (Our waiter asked me if the anchovies were okay with me, so if you don't want them then you're able to omit them.) My boyfriend got the started salad, which he said was ""not that great."" The $4 sounds crazy, but the caesar salad I got was probably three times the size of what my boyfriend got. Also if you love caesar salad like I do then it's worth a try in my opinion.
For his entree he ordered the margarita and added the meaty bolognese. The rolled pasta was beautiful. The flavors were simple and tasty.
He doesn't like coffee flavored things or coffee in general, and I somehow persuaded him to try the tiramisu. He actually enjoyed it! The coffee flavor wasn't too strong for him, which he was worried about. I loved everything about the tiramisu and would definitely order this dessert again.
The service was a bit slow at first, like I mentioned earlier. But after we ordered everything was pretty efficient. Our waiter was really nice and didn't check on us too much or too little. The only thing that I thought was a little annoying was their ""no phone"" policy. I mean. I get it. You want to be the place where people talk to each other instead of looking at a screen the entire time. You don't want people talking loudly on their phones, ignoring the wait-staff because they're on their phones, or doing some other annoying crap like that. Understandable. I just find policies like this to be pretentious and try-hard. Just my opinion."

The decor was definitely bizaarre as they had random things hanging from the ceiling. The bathroom was a little creepy with a recording of someone chanting random numbers.

The pasta special was good, and even the cheese sprinkled on top was notable. Sadly, the steak was too tough and a bit overcooked with an overwhelming parsnip flavor.
When paired with the nice service, fun decor, and creamsicle pannacotta for dessert, this makes for a nice place to visit."
"Bizzarro Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bizzarro-italian-cafe-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica S.","This is the kind of place that ""new Seattle"" needs more of - but not the kind of place you can build in a day. It's the opposite of generic and mod - it's utterly kitschy in the way that only a place that has been around for years can be: suspended from the ceiling are Christmas trees and bicycles for two, while under the glass table toppers are assorted antique photos, and so on. It's a visual treat.
Also a treat is the food. We started with Arancini balls, which were doused in a delicious fresh tomato sauce, but retained a crisp coating around the delicious, cheesy and gooey rice filling. From there, we had the soup of the day, a creamy garlic soup loaded with flavor, which is almost a meal in itself. For my main course, I had the spaghetti carbonara with pea shoots, which featured delightful, fresh pasta noodles, lightly sauced. Honestly, anything would be good with those noodles - they were perfection.
The waitress was friendly and very real, and service was prompt but well-paced. The placed was packed, and though we didn't have to wait for a table, there was a line out the door when we left.
So much old-school awesome! We'll be back."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha G.","This might be my favorite lunch spot in all of Seattle. I wish they were open for longer hours! It's such an interesting find, and I was lucky that I had a coworker bring me here during my first week on the job.
The employees are incredible. They are quick, remember faces, and are relentlessly friendly. You can tell that there are regulars who sit at the bar, who just treasure the experience of coming here. It's a really small menu and venue, but it's definitely part of the charm.
The ingredients are fresh, and they experiment with new flavors - all of them were good. I always went ""from the Garden,"" and was delighted each time."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley K.","Utterly fantastic and a wonderful showcase of the market.
Came here for lunch recently with two others. We each had a different item and all of us loved it. I had the Ocean, someone else got the Farm and the third got the simpler pasta with marinara, parm and basil. Each one was amazing. The open kitchen gives you a front row to watch your food cooked while you wait.
The Ocean was a really well-spiced dish. Pasta in all three was cooked absolutely perfectly, tender but toothsome still.
The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, and they run that place like a Swiss watch. Wonderful to see a kitchen running so smoothly and efficiently.
When you get your food, you can cram in the upstairs if there are seats, or join the mixed market vibes of the eating area down the stairs (just be careful carrying your plate!). Note, if you're getting wine (which I wanted to, but alas it was lunch on a weekday and I didn't want to fall asleep at work) you gotta stay upstairs to eat.
Would definitely come back for an early, early dinner with too much wine for a romantic market date night."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Courtney D.","Great (hidden) Italian spot in the market! My husband has been here for lunch a bunch and I finally got to check it out. I got the ""From the Garden"" meal and it was very good. Honestly, everything on the menu looked delicious, and from what my husband says, it is.
It's one of those casual spots that has the food speak for itself. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Frank L.","Pasta Casalinga continues to dazzle with great value and great tasting pasta dishes.
I am more of a carnivore so the ""From the Garden"" was a miss for me. It was fine, though I felt garden meant more veggies and there were none.
From the Farm is solid. Could use more meat though! Still love it no matter what. Tasty, filling, a tad rich. Can I request 10% less richness? Then it would be perfect!
From the Ocean, a visual delight on top of taste. They speak for themselves. Again, just a tad rich near the end, but that ain't stopping me from finding any excuse to make a special trip to enjoy late/early dinners!
See you soon!!!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Anne M.","Finally got the opportunity to visit this little pasta store in Pike Place market. It is tucked away upstairs so you have to go looking for it if you want some of its delicious pasta. I decided to order the From the Farm option which was a pork-based pasta dish, while my friend got the From the garden option which had pumpkin. Both dishes were obviously prepared very fresh and tasted delicious, and the wait was not long at all!
The store itself is pretty small but we were able to get some small seating on the bar near the kitchen. They also sell alcohol so we were able to get a glass of champagne and Rose to go with our dishes. Both paired nicely with our orders.
I would say that it is a very reasonably priced plate of food especially for lunchtime with the dishes ranging from $11-$15. I would definitely come back here to try more seasonal options when in the Pike Place market area."

The people are so nice and the flavor is so good! I will have to come back soon!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Madison S.","Pasta Casalinga is a small, underestimated pasta only food stop inside a small court within Pike Place market. You walk up to the counter and there's a list of 4 or 5 pasta dishes to choose from. I love this because it tells me that their selection is small (which means in my head, high quality). It didn't disappoint!
The pasta was warm, the sauce was tasty the overall dish was drool worthy. Perfect for a chilly winter day. They had seafood, meat, vegetable, white sauce and traditional pomodoro tomatoe sauce options available. Seating is limited, though I had no trouble finding a couple of counter spots at 12:05 on a Sunday.
I ordered the rigatoni with Vennison Rague (meaty and warm) and my friend ordered the Pomodoro (fresh and tasty).
So good. I'll go back for sure."

Thank goodness this place is open Tuesday - Sunday from 11am to 6pm! I love that it's quick and easy like Corvo. They let you know the selection pasta used for each dish which is helpful. Ordering is quick and simple then you grab a seat by the bar and get to people watch since you are next to Pike's! The wait is never too long since the food comes out immediately always tasting 10/10!! I love this place and always recommend my friends that haven't been. It's such a great lunch to stop at by Pikes & you don't get the crowd."

Location:
Smallish area that seats about 15 people maximum and about 30 seconds walking into the pike place market entrance with daily dozen donuts.
Food:
Looks like it's a small rotating menu and if I lived around here, I would definitely come to try their new dishes often. I had the from the farm option with boar ragout. Pasta was cooked aldente, sooo perfect and yummy.

Pasta Casalinga focuses on four specific pasta dishes categories such as from the sea, from the garden, from the ocean, and a ""everyday"" choice with each dish costing $11-$13.
When we went, we had dishes like the Garden Beet Pasta w/ burrata, and the hearty Lasagna alla Boscaiola, all of which were not too rich or unnecessarily overwhelming with taste."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin N.","A true hidden gem within Pike Place Market. Looking for top-notch pasta without all of the fine-dining hassle? Look no further.
I visited on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this pop up on my yelp home page over and over again. Luckily, despite Pike Place being as busy as it always is on the weekend, there wasn't much of a crowd once I ventured off into the little outlet where this spot is located.
I ordered a ""from the farm,"" which contained some flavorful sausage and mushroom, all enveloped in a fresh pappardelle and olive oil and topped with some salty parmesan. To be honest, I did have pretty high expectations, and I'm glad that they were met upon my first bite. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sausage and parmesan provided some nice salt while the mushroom's earthy flavor rounded out the dish well. Being that the sauce was oil-based, it didn't feel too heavy like cream-based pastas tend to be. Also, the portion sizes are deceptively perfect. At first glance, it's a small serving, but when you finish eating it, you'll realize that you'll be just full without feeling bloated - I love that.
The staff were all super nice - one of them even checked on me to make sure I was doing ok, despite there not being any actual waiter service. The are some bar seats in the immediate vicinity, and the sunflowers on the tables brings a smell that actually transports you to the countryside. If no seats are there, there are also some tables in the general area that any Pike Place visitor can sit at. Pro tip: BUS YOUR OWN DISHES - there's a bin across from the register where you put your dirty plates/silverware.
For the quality of pasta here, I'm so used to paying upwards of $20, yet the fact that I paid less than $15 means that the value here is hard to beat if you're looking for quality pasta. I'll be sure to come back to try other menu items."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan N.","We decided to stop in this quieter place in like place that had spaces to sit, and time to think about our order. The server seemed like she was rushing us even though there was no line, so that left a little to be desired.
I ordered the From The Ocean ($13) which came with sockeye salmon, zucchini, olives, capers and caserecce noodles. The noodles we're nice and creamy, and the cherry tomatoes were an awesome sweetness to cut through the dish. The olives weren't too strong tasting, and the pasta tasted incredibly fresh. Only complaint is that i didn't get much salmon in my dish. Wished for a better proportion.
I would come here again for a safe choice in pike place because I have been to spots in the market that serve too little for too much. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was a solid choice for the overwhelming options in the market."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Angie A.","Wow that was lovely! We live in Seattle but love playing tourists and visiting Pike Place market on a Sunday sometimes. This place was quite hidden from the main touristy part of the market. We found it accidentally. It was so charming and reminding us of Europe so we couldn't help but try it! We had been eating our way through the market at this point and decided to share just 1 dish. We ordered spaghetti with pomodoro sauce. It was soooooo yummy! Perfect amount of food. Pasta cooked a bit too al dente for me but nice and chewy. We didn't know we could add ricotta and or speck to the dish. We will definitely do that next time. It was late lunch but the place was quite busy. Limited seating but we didn't have problems finding space for 2. I was excited and asking them few questions. Staffs were friendly. Dishes came out in good amount of time. Sit at the little corner bar if you enjoy seeing the actions in the kitchen.
Overall a lovely fresh home made pasta restaurant. Menus are simple but delish! We cannot wait to come back!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nam N.","What a nice hidden gem for authentic pasta dishes. I've frequented Pike Place Market all my life and I've seen Pasta Casalinga tucked away in the southern most part of the market - but for some reason, never felt compelled to go. I think a part of me thought ""it's probably touristy and/or overly expensive.""
Last week - I walked by again but this time - my gut said, ""just try it."" I had the pasta pomodoro and the casalinga lasagna. The pomodoro's sauce was extremely light, the pasta perfectly al dente. It was filling yet, light. Such a simple dish full over flavor.
The Casalinga Lasagna... this was a dream i never knew i wanted to have come true. Im used to the americanized ""loaded with ground beef and processed cheese and smother it in tomato sauce"" type of lasagna. Casalinga gave me a taste of elegance and desire. Smooth and silky pasta, sweet peas and mushrooms for contrast and flavor. The pork sausage so delicatley seasoned for you to actually taste meat and not pure salt. The creamy smoothness of the bechamel sauce paired with the fullness of the grated fresh parmesean - it was a symphony of flavors that was dancing in my mouth.
Few and far between do I eat something that simply pauses time for a brief moment. And makes me feel at home, it was like the moment when Ego (the food critic) took a bit of ratatouille in the movie Ratatouille - and despite me being Asian, i had that same sense of ""takes me back home"" feeling when I eat this lasagna. Its so delicious!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff R.","If you're in the area around Pikes Market and you want amazingly fresh (aka- hand made to order) pasta, then look no further than Pasta Casalinga.
The location is a little harder to find, as you have to venture out of the main halls of the market and find your way into an interior portion of the market buildings.
Once you find it, it might not seem like much, but the humble walk-up counter will provide to be some of the best pasta you have. There is limited seating, so don't be surprised if you have to sit close to someone along the bar, or have to walk a little to find some seating back closer to the main market area.
No matter where you eat it, do yourself a favor and track down this hidden gem and enjoy some fresh pasta."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Morgan J.","Great fast yet nice dining option in the market I had no idea about until today! Only 5 options for pasta, but don't worry, there is a seafood, meat, and vegetarian option! It looks like they rotate the menu often, other than the pomodoro and lasagna, which stay the same. And you'll be glad. The radiatore was good but the lasagna was great. There is plenty of counter seating or if you have a larger group you can take them to tables down one level to seating there. You order at the counter. They serve alcohol. So cute!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Willy M.","Came by for lunch with a few buds, one of them is a finicky eater, told him to suck it up and deal with it and branch out a little, it's pasta for crying out loud!
Anyways, this pasta spot is located inside Pike Place Market, it's around the corner from DeLaurenti, it's where Honest Biscuits used to be, near the atrium entrance.
Friendly greetings as we walked up, they have about 4-6 pastas available, it's a rotating menu so don't fall in love with it as it can be more of a hit & run depending on seasonal ingredients.
I decided to choose the ""From the Ocean"" option which was sable fish with paccheri pasta, red peppers, olives, capers and this olive oil sauce. It was very good! The paccheri pasta was great, love large tube pasta! I rarely think of adding fish to pasta, I did once add canned tuna to mac & cheese when I was in college. The sable fish in this dish was tasty, went well with all the other ingredients and overall very delicious!
There are a few other options like a sausage pasta dish, a vegetarian pasta dish and their popular lasagna. I think Ill try that next time.
Portions aren't large nor small, it's actually quite perfect, we left comfortably full and satisfied. Prices are about $10 -$13 depending on which pasta dish you choose. Staff is friendly, everything is cooked to order, fresh pasta for each dish, there's stools and a ledge for you to eat at but just around the corner from them, there are community tables you can sit at, we just took our dishes down there to eat. It's no major physical feat to return your bowl back to their bins, so be sure to do that.
We all enjoyed our pasta dishes, even the finicky eater friend wants to come back again, you're welcome bud!
Great pasta place, definitely coming back again!"

- Crab bruschetta: 4 stars
- Mushroom polenta: 4 stars
- Seafood ravioli: 5 stars
- Duck w/cherry: 5 stars

This is not a family style super loud old school Italian restaurant. But if you are looking for a great spot for a work dinner / lunch or maybe a quiet spot for dinner with the wife - the food here is GREAT. Great wine selection as well.

Caesar - 4.5 very good. The romaine is a little too green for me but they give you anchovies which I love.
Veal Scaloppini - 4.5 star very good. A great serving and the sauce was perfect.
Pasta's - 4 star. I've had a few and they are good but not blow your socks off good.

I already love this place but was even more impressed by how they handled a large party. We were originally going to have about 20 and were going to have a private space, but stuff happens and the number went down to about 12-15 they adjusted things quickly we were no longer in the private area but everything went smoothly. One of the things they do well here has always been the service. Friendly and very accommodating. My go to is always the Spaghettini Ortolano
with arugula, goat cheese, tomatoes and pine nuts. It's a nice light pasta dish perfect for spring and summer. Even if it was winter I would order it! The combination of all the ingredients just works perfectly.
Our entire table had a varied ends of orders from just soup and salad to salads with pasta entrees. Almost all of us got dessert after being presented with the beautiful dessert display. I went with the canolli which is not something I usually order but I enjoyed theirs immensely. Nice and crisp and just the right balance of everything else. Our waiter was so entertaining.

"Il Terrazzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-terrazzo-carmine-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Naveed N.","Il Terrazzo Carmine has been a long time favorite of mine in Seattle. You don't come here looking for the hip or swanky hipster foodie restaurant scene. Those culinary fads have a place of their own, but Seattle is also home to some great classic and traditional fine dining experiences. Being in the northwest, this isn't a stuffy upscale experience but holds its own to great restaurants while still maintaining a sense of comfort and familiarity.
Having introduced a friend to this place a few months prior, we tentatively planned to come in for dinner sometime early in the new year and that time finally came around.
We ordered the baked eggplant, and the Caeser salad to start while deciding on a bottle of wine. Both were great choices, and while I'm not going to deduct points here- I would like to point out to management that the eggplant dish could have come out more warm. If you're one to enjoy the creaminess of eggplant while it is still hot with a well-melted cheese, perhaps you can make that request.
For dinner, we shared the gnocchi Sorrentina, the pesto prawn fettuccine, and the roasted free-range duck. The pesto was fresh and vibrant, with prawns cooked to perfection. The Gnocchi light and flavorful, and the duck was a great choice as well, despite being torn between that and the bone-in pork chop (next time..)
Overall a fantastic experience brought to a perfect close with a couple of espressos and a creme brulee to share. Whether it is a special occasion, celebration, date night, or just another excuse for a nice dinner out- don't miss out on Il Terrazzo Carmine. Cheers!"

But so far, one of my top pasta places in Seattle. From an amazing dinner to the incredible service, our evening was well spent! We both agreed that this was one of our best dining experiences we've ever had. It was definitely very memorable. We were very lucky to have a table since we reserved last minute for anniversary!
Our hostess and server were incredible. You know it's legit, when your hostess offers to take your jackets. At the end of night, she noticed taking our selfies outside and offered to take our photos. How sweet was she! Low key, she probably saw us struggling. And man, our server was so so kind and very attentive! He knew the menu from the heart.
It was a seafood night for us. For our antipasti, we started out with the Bruschetta con Granchio (dungeness crab w/ vine marinated tomatoes w/ basil oil). It was something we normally don't order, but it was very refreshing starter! I think we should've ordered something else to start since we ended up order more seafood.
- For his dish, he requested for the Linguine Alle Vongole (fresh Manila calms, chilies, garlic, parsley, & olive oil). He probably won't order this dish again because he's not a huge fan on Linguine, but he really wanted clams & he got a bunch of them!
- Me on the other hand ordered the Ravioli Pesce (large ravioli filled w/ crab, shrimp and spinach, with lobster sauce). Rich was so rich and buttery. It served well with the crab. I'm a very saucy girl, so I do wish there was more sauce since the crab didn't have too much seasoning.
At the end of the night, we were full on the amazing bread with this sweet balsamic vinegar and oil olive, topped with this creme brûlée we choose from their dessert tray! Definitely keep this restaurant on our books and coming back. Cute date spot and to dress up for!"

We were so impressed with the food and the service was perfect, down to the last detail.
We ordered:
- Half a dozen oysters (5/5): So good and very fresh.
- Fricasse Di Funghi Selvaggi (5/5): This absolutely blew us away. The wild mushrooms were perfectly sauteed and seasoned, and the polenta was amazing - very flavorful without being overly salty.
- Scaloppine Di Vitello Al Limone & Capperi (5/5): The waiter, seeing how indecisive I was between ordering a pasta or this entree, kindly told me they could replace the red potatoes in this dish with whichever type of pasta I liked, so I decided on a side of linguini with pesto -- which was so simple but delicious. The veal itself was nicely done (it's more like a cutlet). All the entrees were served with a side of white broccolini, which I'd never had before but looked beautiful and tasted fresh! Was truly impressed with the attentiveness to detail at Il Terrazzo Carmine.
- I can't quite remember the name of the dessert -- the ""menu"" was actually a platter of 6 options they had that night, so we choose a 3-layered cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! They also had creme brulee, tiramisu, cheesecake, red velvet cake, etc.
Definitely want to come back here! Beautiful ambiance, delicious food, delightful service :-)"

"Il Terrazzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-terrazzo-carmine-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marvin G.","A good restaurant with good and pleasant service. I had hoped it would be outstanding as some of their reviews and certainly the prices suggest. The pasta dishes were fairly robust, though not super flavorful. Soups were pleasant if a little scant on ingredients. Bread was very good, though served with butter rather than olive oil and vinegar. Our server did the thing listing the dinner specials without mentioning prices, which always bugs me (it seems manipulative; you have to ask the price and feel like a cheapskate, or order and hope for the best while feigning wealthy nonchalance, or just avoid the specials altogether).
Tends more toward art food than a solid meal, not quite in the ""eat before you go"" category but leaning that way. Noise level was quite tolerable. A little too much reliance on salt in the dishes, though not terrible.
I'd go back but would not go out of my way to."

We stopped in Friday evening before a show for dinner. I started at the bar and had a drink while awaiting the arrival of my better half. I talked to the bartender and he offered to go back to the restaurant and see if he might get us a table. As luck would have it they had one table left and we got it.
From start to finish everything was first rate and amazingly tasty. Our server was attentive and skilled - exactly what I look for to help guide us in a new place.
Prices were appropriate for such an extremely high caliber restaurant. We both agreed that this was one of the very best dining experiences we've ever had.
I'd recommend this place for your next special occasion.
Reservations are advised - you may not be as lucky as we were."
"Il Terrazzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-terrazzo-carmine-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Melissa L.","Made reservations for an Italian dinner on a Saturday night and it exceeded my expectations.
Its located in the back of the lobby of Merrill Place. We arrived on time and stepped inside to the Host stand. They gave us the option of inside or outside and we opted to be seated outside since it was a beautiful, warm, summer evening.
The patio has chandeliers, fire pit, white linens, candlelights and fresh flowers on the tables and pillows at my seat. It was beautiful.
Service was very good and attentive. Water and bread was brought out quickly to the table.
We started with Prosciutto con Melone. Cantaloup is in season and it was delivered ripe with imported parma prosciutto. Very Good.
Ordered a 1/2 dozen of the oysters of the day. These were fresh and served at the perfect temperature and with a mignonette. The mignonette was all that was needed to balance the saltiness.
For my entree, I ordered the Risotto of the Day. Served w/Wagyu and Gorgonzola. The wagyu was not as tender/buttery as I expected and the gorgonzola was mild. I had hoped for stronger flavors. However, the risotto was prepared well.
We were too full to consider dessert.
Good cocktail & wine selection; started with a cocktail and ended with a chianti.
Service was attentive and spot on.
Borderline 5 star experience; a repeat visit may bring it up to 5 stars."

"Il Terrazzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-terrazzo-carmine-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katie Y.","Yummm, I love Il Terrazzo Carmine. We came here on a weekday around dinnertime and had failed to make a reservation in advance. Luckily, they said they could seat us if we were out within an hour and a half - of course, we agreed.
We started with the caprese and the burrata, and although the portions were a bit small to split between 4 people, the dishes were spectacular. Service was a little bit slow, as was the food - we had kept up our end of the bargain by being ready to order almost as soon as we sat down and went over the 90m mark. Luckily, the host came over and told us that he had sorted out things on his end and we were free to stay as long as we liked.
I highly, highly recommend the fettuccine al pesto. The prawns it come with are a healthy portion, and the noodles are clearly homemade as they almost melt in your mouth. It's flavorful and a decent sized portion. This place does feel a bit stuffy, but I think that's the vibe they're going for. We had just came from work so we all had our work backpacks/bags with us and felt a little out of place having to find somewhere to place them, as the restaurant is a little crowded with tables. Still, if you're a pasta lover then this place is one I'd highly recommend for you."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia A.","My favorite cuisine is Italian food so my husband and I like to venture out to try all the Italian restaurants there are in Seattle. This restaurant is in a really hidden location (it's the right most business in the plaza) and there's no well lit/big sign at all in the front to help you locate the restaurant as you drive here. But note that the small parking lot IS available to park at when you eat here!
We ordered the Bruschetta to start - lovely! It contained lots of tomatoes so that was a very pleasant start. For dinner, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Lasagna. When you order your entrees....order one between two people. Don't say I didn't warn you!! The portion size is GINORMOUS (see pics) and you definitely want to leave room for dessert. Unless you want lots of leftovers (I mean that is not a bad thing), then split an entree. :P The actual entrees were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert, we ordered the Canoli - light and YUMMY!! We were disappointed there wasn't Panna Cotta on the dessert menu but we got over that pretty quickly. :P
Highly recommend trying this restaurant! It's a hidden gem. :)"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy I.","Wish it had nicer atmosphere in the restaurant but it's full of old school fluorescent lights dimmed with decorative covers. So we took the food to go. The chicken Marsala was more bland than we like. We both felt the chicken Parmesan was very good and would go back for that again. Meatballs and spaghetti was a meal we would order again too.
Don't forget the garlic knots are great!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Megha B.","This is one of my favorite hole in the wall restaurant in Seattle.
The food is very authentic and amazing. I love the garlic knots, spaghetti aglio e olio, harvest gnocchi and the pizza. The house red is usually pretty decent.
I like the server and manager at this restaurant, they are both really friendly and it's always a great time dining here.
I will continue eating here!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mindful M.","Absolute hidden gem. Every time we come I'm stunned at how good the food is for the price, and how laid back it is! Non-pretentious, incredible homemade and authentic food, cozy atmosphere. I'm always shocked this place isn't packed any time we come in, but on the rare occasion it is they're always happy to suggest takeout which is just as nice."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Clay B.","What a wonderful place to sit and have delicious homemade Italian food, we were waited on by the chef.
She makes everything in house and wonderful! Higher recommend the Lamb Ragout sandwich, the lunch menu is small, but they have a much larger menu for dinner that starts at 4pm. Lunch is from 11:am- 2:00pm, get there early as it is a small restaurant but very nice."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathy A.","I definitely found my new favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle! This place is perfect. You would never notice it from the street view and when you walk in you're immediately thinking ""wait? really? this place does good italian food?"" It is a quintessential hole in the wall restaurant without any bells and whistles on ambiance but the food and service far exceed expectations! Portions are large and the price points are hard to beat. The farro salad is massive and has huge chunks of goat cheese. Quite tasty! The arancini are hearty and topped with plenty of tomato sauce. The harvest gnocchi was divine! Rich, cheesy but still a nice light pasta dish. Our server was lovely as well and the food came out rather quick! I can't wait to return!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer T.","Came here last Friday with a friend and we indulged in the ""Family Style"" meal, where you choose what you pay (suggested $20-50 pp) and the chef curates a multi-course dinner for the table. Per our server's recommendation, we did $35 to bring us from appetizer to dessert, and this was no joke best $35 I've ever spent at a restaurant!! The quantity and quality of food served here would have easily been $60+ pp at other restaurants. So happy I've found this hidden gem!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great value, authentic Italian comfort food.
More on the food:
- Appetizer (5/5...peep my photo to see the full spread!!): A few of my favorites were the caesar salad w/ crab meat, steamed clams in white wine, deep fried gnocchi, tomatoes & burrata, and toasted baguette w/ this amaaazing pistachio spread. I probably could've been full off just the first course! But of course, I paced myself in anticipation for the other dishes... :)
- Pesto tortellini with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes (5/5): This was easily the most decadent and well-made tortellini I've ever had! The pasta itself had the perfect amount of bite/chewiness, the pesto was so fresh/aromatic, and the creamy goat cheese + the sweet-tartness of the sun-dried tomato made every bite taste like a little piece of heaven. I'm typically not blown away by tortellini but this dish packed so much flavor!
- Steak w/ roasted asparagus (4/5): The steak cut like butter and the asparagus was perfectly roasted and seasoned...it was a simple dish but was cooked really well and complemented the bold flavors in our other courses. Dessert:
- Cheesecake w/ chocolate salami (4/5): Loved how the cheesecake was so fluffy/light! Also enjoyed nibbling on the salami-shaped dark chocolates pieces with walnuts.
Our server was super helpful and friendly -- he consistently went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our food and our water cups were never empty. The restaurant itself is modestly sized and modestly decorated...the ambiance is nothing to write home about, but the incredible food, service, and value made Aglio E Olio a 5/5 experience for me!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nikhil T.","This is a hidden gem. One of the handful places in Seattle that can serve a delicious main course under $20. We have been here twice and both times found the food to be delicious and the portion sizes large (you're guaranteed to have leftovers). The olive oil and fresh bread is heavenly. The pesto pasta is great as well. The music and decor is quirky Italian. The server is fantastic to talk to."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jon H.","So far this is my favorite Italian place in the city. The bruschetta is delicious, as is the parm and practically anything you can order!
My advice: come early in the day before the evening rush or call in a reservation, the restaurant is very small and fills up quickly (literally maybe 5 or 6 tables)"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Travis G.","I am so happy to be so close to this place! There are a ton of great items on the menu, but I keep going back to the strip steak with the gorgonzola gnocchi. So good and a great price. Also, the bruschetta is a standout.

"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joe S.","Amazing. From the outside it doesnt look like much, but the food here is tied for my favorite Italian place. The staff is very personable and welcoming.
My go-to is the 4 cheese pasta, I don't know if I would consider it my favorite dish ever, but as the time I'm writing this, I'm having a hard time thinking of anything that I could definitively say tops it."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda E.","The best italian food ever! Also the best service I can get on this new year day! I had the seafood rigatoni with a lemon zest alfredo sauce. Mighty delicious!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff B.","4.5 stars.
What a surprise. Our son wanted to have birthday dinner here, so the five of us went on a Saturday evening.
FOOD: 4.5 stars. We had $35 per person dinner, leaving the chef to decide the contents. This included for the vegan among us. Excellent value. Several appetizers (green salad, cold cuts, olives, mozzarella, bruschetta, artichokes, etc), pasta meat dish, lamb chops (and equivalents for the vegan). Followed by dessert. The bday boy received a free tiramisu - heavenly; the rest of us had chocolate gelato with fruit - excellent!
We also had a carafe of house red wine from Montepulciano.
SERVICE: 5.0 stars. The gentleman and lady servers worked hard to ensure we were very satisfied.
AMBIANCE: 4.0 stars. Nicely done, attractive (yet simple) interior.
TIP: Make reservations, at least for a Sat evening. They were fully booked the evening we dined. Quite a few people came in for take-out."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jim P.","Oh My!
Came for lunch, and if you blink you may drive right past this place. Nothing fancy about the building or the interior for that matter (never mind the greasy floors) but man they can put out some dang nice foods.
We had the porchetta sandwich, the mortadella sandwich, rigatoni bowl, and an alfredo bowl (with porchetta). The sandwiches are huge, great bread, fillings super hot and plentiful. I also love the gardenia mix.
The pastas come with ceasar salad and I garlic knot that you wish you had about a dozen more of.
Prices are very reasonable, now if I could only convince them to open a place in West Seattle my live would be complete."

I don't come here as often as I would like because, well, weight. I always eat waaaayyyyy too much when I'm here. The hole in the wall aspect is nice and cozy, but I do wish they had an upmarket version as well so I could come here as a night out.
Also, I wish they would deliver with someone other than Bite Squad."

"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ryan T.","I'm so glad I found this place. It's small, but the ambiance and homemade food make for one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. Our server had excellent recommendations for food, including gluten free and pescatarian and gluten free options. In fact for gluten free options, many things on the menu including deep fried dishes and pasta, can be made without wheat to perfection.
Get a reservation or go early!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rahul D.","Against my selfish desire to keep this place secret, I'm writing a public review of this place.
I have been here several times with varying party sizes and types (2, 4, 10, some vegetarians, some pescatarians, typical omnivores, etc.), for my birthday, parents' birthday, going-away parties, date nights, etc.
I have had the family-style serving every time (35 for antipasti, pasta, meat, and dessert!!). The staff is excellent at accommodating dietary restrictions that vary throughout the party, and their choices always satisfy.
The quality is always excellent, the service is always great, the drinks are always smooth and well-priced, and the value is always incredible.
I hope you all get to enjoy this small restaurant, be sure to reserve ahead of time due to limited seating."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","AJ A.","Had the mortadella and fried egg sandwich for lunch. DELICIOUS!
Quaint, lots of personality. Hidden away in the back of a tiny collection of ground floor shops. It's actually around the corner and in back."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin L.","This is my hands-down favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I live in Capitol Hill and the Italian places are nice, but they're a bit upscale and hit or miss as they try out the hottest and hippest ingredients on the market.
Aglio e Olio, however, I found randomly when I decided I needed a bite to eat and was in the area. It's a small intimate restaurant and I was thinking: ""Sigh, whatever. At least I can just get pasta or something.""
Wow. This place has hands down my favorite meatballs I've ever had in my entire life. They're huge, and they taste AMAZING. I've been going back more frequently now, and I also have to recommend the Calamari. It's not deep-fried, it's not crispy, but instead it's this AMAZING pan-seared quality. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and try the Calamari. Ridiculously good!
Anyways. I didn't realize I was coming into a wonderful small family-style and family-tasting Italian restaurant until I tasted the food, and at that point I realized I was in a good place.
I love you, Aglio e Olio! I hope you stay here for a very long time."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristin B.","It is a small hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss, but is sooo worth it. The food is among the best Italian food in the city. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new or off the radar.
I had the chicken parmigiana and a caesar salad. Both were delicious. The chicken parm was perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was amazing and tasty. The serving sizes were ample and more than enough for a single person.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
Accessibility: This is a very small restaurant and it is not too accessible. The washrooms are up a step or two and squeezed in a corner. The tables are all squeezed together. There is no room to sit and wait for a table. The good news is it is all tables and chairs. If you are able to work with a tight squeeze and a place that can get noisy because of the smallness of the space, then you're good to go."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kira T.","Delightful. Cozy and intimate, with excellent service. The location is quite special - right across from tiny Weather Watch Park in West Seattle, with its breathtaking, glorious views.
The lamb shank special was ""to die for"" according to my friend who ordered it (I don't eat meat). My penne puttanesca was spicy and bracing and packed with flavor. We shared bruschetta and a caprese salad that featured superbly fresh, amazing mozzarella (although the tomatoes were a bit pallid... I blame the time of year). A couple of our party ordered pizzas. One pronounced his ""just fine"" and the other (my husband) thought his was flavorful, but ""too bready."" He's from NYC, so he likes a verrrry thin crust.
Dessert was amazing: the four of us shared a regular and a limoncello tiramisu. Both were HUGE. Both were tender and fluffy and delightful, and neither were cloyingly sweet. The flavor of the liqueur and cream shone through.
WARNING: do not trust the prices posted online! Most items on the menu were between one dollar and four dollars MORE than the online price. We still got out of there for $250 bucks for 4 of us - including 1 1/2 carafes of their decent house Montepulciano and tip - but we were expecting it to be a tad less.
That said, I would return."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica R.","Best pasta spot in West Seattle, hands down! This spot is a tiny little spot on the west/south part of Alki, and definitely worth making the trip.
We have come here several times now, and most recently for my birthday. We had a group of 12 and they were very accommodating to have such a large group in such a small space. This time I got the rigatoni con ricotta, and that is probably one of my favorite dishes here. It's a rigatoni noodle with white sauce, cheese, onions, and pancetta.
They also brought me a birthday tiramisu! Overall love this place and will definitely be coming back!"
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","West Seattle institution with family-owned environment and hearty Italian classics.
The restaurant is located in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking right in Alki. La Rustica is quaint with some old-world Italian decor and white tablecloths - really what you envision when you think ""family-owned Italian restaurant"" so I was into it.
We arrived with a large party for a birthday (reservations made). For a Wednesday evening, it was very busy so I would recommend making reservations. The space is not big (inside or out on the patio), so I don't think they host large parties often. They sat us quickly, and started taking drink orders. They almost immediately brought us water and bread.
After taking our food order, service seemed to slow a bit. We had a late attendee, and they were not acknowledged until we finally caught our server's attention after 15 minutes. It was difficult as the service was great up until this point, and we seemed to have lost our server between ordering food and receiving food.
When the food arrived (which did take a while, but it was a big party and I won't dock points for that), I had to leave for an appointment so I got my pasta to go. I had ordered their squid ink pasta special. It was alright, but I'll likely get something else next time (everything else looked amazing). It was described to have a marinara/alfredo creamy sauce and the sauce didn't seem creamy to me, so I think I may have had different expectations - it was a very large portion, the pasta itself was good, and it had lots of seafood in it. The pastas are also served with a dinner salad - the homemade dressing on those were AWESOME - very garlicky and generously topped.
They serve wine by the carafe for a good price, and the food menu is large enough to give plenty of variety. I will definitely be coming back, this time with a much smaller party, to try out some of the other pastas that looked decadent and have a more intimate experience. I imagine that my star rating will go up after going with a smaller group.
Note: they can't split the check but can take up to 3 payments on a check, so keep it in mind if you're with a big group."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jan C.","Although there are some positives about our experience here, we will not return.
Pros: Our server, Nadia, was very personable and helpful.
The antipasto mista plate was huge. Good vairety of meats, but only one kind of cheese.
Setting is very nice
Cons: The noise level is not conducive to a pleasant experience. I used my phone to check the decibel level and it was pretty steady at 80 db with times up to 87 db. Not fun!
While the wait staff was pleasant there were apparently not enough of them as there was a lot of waiting for water, etc.
The food was underwhelming. In particular, the carbonara was dry to the point of having very little flavor. I am a carbonara fan and I don't want it to be soaking in sauce, but there was almost no sauce at all on this dish.
Parking is difficult to find during the dinner hour."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Aleksandr F.","Not sure about how is food here. We did not have a chance to try it. Came to this restaurant in 15 minutes after opening but owner told us that no free tables for us and we need to wait 20-30 minutes for it. We've waited about 1 hour but couldn't wait more and came out hungry. So book table before you going to come here."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","M T.","My husband and I came here for a date night and it did not disappoint! We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait!
I had the lasagna and it was delicious and so hearty, everything pasta should be! My husband had the chicken parmigiana and loved it. We wrapped up the night with the tiramisu, which was just delightful! The meal overall was delicious and the service was great. Food was the closest we've had to pasta we had on our honeymoon in Italy.
Come here and enjoy!!! The wait is worth the amazing food you get and the ambiance."

The restaurant is so beautiful if you sit on the patio. The food is really good. But I wouldn't eat there after what I experienced after, they definitely served me some bad food.
Plenty of people have been there without getting sick, but plenty of people have gotten sick too. Go at your own risk!"
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Aaron F.","We had our first meal at La Rustica. A cozy, welcoming atmosphere, similar vibe to a rustic country home in Tuscany. The service was excellent, courses served timely, and just the right amount of attention. The lamb gnocchi, while tender and well presented, was too heavily salted. My partner had the shrimp scampi, which we both agreed was also too salty and grilled shrimp slightly overdone. The last critique would be the cannolis we both had for dessert, which would have been a joy to my Italian grandmother had the chef decided to leave off the discordant note of raspberry drizzle. That said, the wine, coffee, appetizers, salads and service were superb. We'll try it again at some point and see how it goes."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","SI G.","This place has really gone down hill. Canned mushrooms, terrible marinara pasta, canned whipped cream and ridiculous prices. They asked if we wanted to upgrade the salads to Caesar and then charged full prices for the salads that were supposed to be included in with the specials. Then they charge another $5 for anchovies. Will never go back. I gave it two stars instead of one because the waitress was attentive and friendly."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle L.","Really cute place tucked away on Alki Beach. I don't know why there's so many bad reviews on service our server was super pleasant. Loved their garlic bread and salad - but next time I would skip appetizers only because you can't NOT eat a decent amount of garlic bread which fills you up. By the time our main courses came out I was like 60% full haha! I thought their full carafe of house cab sav for $38 was quite reasonable. Loved the bolognese pasta and my husband's lasagna was great too! Would definitely come back for sureee!"
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nancy W.","It's been probably three years since I've been here but love it just the same. Took a friend of mine who had never been and she was in love with the place. They take no reservations so you need to get here early or be prepared for close to an hour wait. Tonight they opened at 5, we got there at 5:15, being told already that there was a 45 minute wait. Fortunately, we got called about 20 minutes later. I ordered a cosmopolitan which was great and we ordered the calamari appetizer, I ordered the lasagna with bolognese sauce and she ordered the chicken parmesan. Because of the wait at our table for service and then for the meal, we got a complimentary salad which was very nice. My drink was excellent but then there was very little meat in the bolognese sauce of my lasagna and that's primarily what I was getting it for. Not only did the wait person take it off the bill, but gave us both complimentary desserts. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Very small setting and very warm and cozy. Menu has excellent choices as well as the wine list and cocktail menu. This place is worth the wait!"
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lex D.","Amazing food and service. Get the wild boar you will not be disappointed. Everything is fresh and made to order. Be careful loading up on the bread, it is so delicious you'll forget you have a meal coming. Unless you get there at opening you will have to wait a while. They do not take reservations. Wish they would especially for special occasions. When being seated ask not to be seated at the table near the restroom. Awkward when people are standing waiting to pee as you try to dine..and reminds you that you are near the toilet. They really need to eliminate that table. There is a little bar in back by little I mean it accommodates about 7 to 8 very tiny space. Again if you're not there at opening your wait will be over and hour. Worth a try if you dont mind waiting."

"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elisabeth P.","We were lucky enough to snag a table at this happening place on a perfect Seattle Saturday evening. We'd actually had reservations at a different restaurant to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary, but were unable to eat due to their inflexibility with my food allergy. The husband searched restaurants near us offering gf menu items and we discovered La Rustica.
Located down near the water, it has a beautiful view from the patio. Parking was a little tricky, but we enjoyed the walk along the water to and from our car. This family owned place is about as authentic as it gets. With the owner greeting guests and standing outside beckoning passerbys into his establishment, family as servers, and family in the kitchen, you immediately start to get in the mood for a home cooked meal.
We were put on a waiting list for the busy Saturday night rush, but it moved quickly and we were seated outside on the little covered patio with hanging plants and a gorgeous view of the water. Our server stopped by and took our order. Not only was she able to point out their gf items, she also assured me they'd prep my food with allergy precautions, oooo yah bring me allll the pasta.
They have a great selection of gf items to choose from. We started with their house salad which was simplistic yet incredibly fresh and delicious. I went for the gf penne with ricotta which was basically a creamy cheesy bunch of goodness. The husband loved the manicotti he ordered and had nothing left to take home.
We stopped back again just recently and had another perfect dining experience. The husband got the gnocchi and I had the gf penne with a creamy tomato sauce and beef filet. We finished with a decadent chocolate gf cake..There was not a crumb remaining on our plates.
With delicious authentic Italian cuisine at a great price, excellent service, and an unbeatable view, we left fatted and happy and looking forward to our return."

"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cole M.","Good Italian restaurant in West Seattle.
I am normally critical of ""Italian"" restaurants and sometimes a glance at the menu will give me an idea.
In the menu we saw, Lamb is translated into ""Pecora"" which means Sheep. Lamb is ""Agnello"". One wonders why in this modern age, people do not use a proof reader or a decent translator. In any case...
We were seated by the corner window which offers the view of the sound and sunset. We were greeted by the kind owner, and served with fresh, warm, flavorful bread. I ordered an Italian beer and my friend a red wine.
We ordered the Calamari in umido and bruschetta as antipasto followed by Fettuccine alla Carbonara and Risotto Con Salsiccia e Funghi. I found the carbonara dry and bland, I couldn't taste the guanciale, nor the egg. My friend liked his dish. We did not have room for dessert, maybe too much bread...
Judging by the various reviews this place could be a hit or a miss. My suggestion is to go, perhaps not on busy weekends.
If you're out on a date or some romantic event, the table at the corner with windows facing the West, would be the perfect place to have dinner at."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","R D.","Let me start by saying that this restaurant has a gorgeous view. It's a cozy family run place that serves delicious authentic Italian food and the service was excellent too.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the owner / host and showed to our table. We started off with some complimentary home made warm bread. For appetizers we got the caprese buratta plate and mushrooms with polenta. For our mains, we had the prawns risotto and Pollo buccatini pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food was rich, but I am not complaining, it was delectable.
Against better judgement, we decided to order chocolate tort to share for dessert, and I am so glad we did. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the consistency of the tort was spot on.
Overall - delicious food, friendly service, and gorgeous view. Highly recommended!"
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mel S.","We had a late night dinner yesterday (Friday) night and I woke up this morning after the most glorious carb/fat-8-hour coma. The restaurant is cozy, the interior is dark and does its best old-world impression, but the food is delicious and the service is attentive.
Yesterday was a refeed day for me so I went nuts on carbs:
-bread: buttery, tasty, and addictive. If you get bread straight out of the oven and not overly baked you'll have to practice extreme restraint from eating the entire basket
-calamari to start was refreshing. It isn't your typical fried version. It's almost prepared like a soup and can be spicy depending on how heavy handed the preparer is with the spices so beware. I piled my Calamari on the bread (bc carbs are life)
-I ordered the sepia spaghetti special with seafood made with Alfredo sauce. I love Alfredo sauce but it can get sickening if you overdo it. I barely made it through half my dish (bc I was carbed out and I wore tight jeans) but I'm convinced that this dish is amazing. I was disappointed in myself for not finishing the entire thing but I did my best and my husband will now get to enjoy the leftovers today (today is not a high carb day).
-husband got the Manfredo gnocchi (which isn't traditional gnocchi FYI). He loved the lamb but wasn't impressed with the non-traditional gnocchi.
-we also ordered a half carafe of wine which paired well with our meals.
No desserts were ordered, unfortunately. My pants just wouldn't allow it.
We will definitely return. I was told they take reservations for large parties so I plan to bring my family here for my brother's graduation!"

"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Chandra D.","I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband while on a weekend trip in Seattle.
Great vibe and atmosphere! It was very busy and waiting in the lobby/entrance area is a little awkward. Most people didn't want to wait outside in the cold, but in the summer this would work--not so much on a chilly, misty October evening. It was crowded and I know when I'm eating, I don't want people hovering over me or bumping into me. If they can figure out the waiting issue, this would be great!
Our food and service was top-notch. We shared the arborio' risotto with goat cheese and basil, and I found it to be flavorful; each flavor profile was tasty. I enjoyed the salty goat cheese! The risotto wasn't mushy, either. It was tender and just right. I ordered the ravioli of the day, and it was also good. However, I really enjoyed my risotto.
Great food and great service!"

The server seemed annoyed at any questions and also seemed to be in a hurry (it was on a Thursday so not very busy). He was not very friendly and came around twice or so doing just the bare minimum.
The grilled calamari ($16), had an excruciating charred flavor. My pasta, which was the ravioli of the day, tasted just okay nothing amazing. This was definitely my first and last time coming here.
I wouldn't recommend it."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ibrahim A.","I had a special occasion and decided to spend this occasion at Barolo. I was looking to try an Italian place and checked the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I called to make a reservation and informed them that this is a special occasion and they acknowledged my reservation and informed me that they will accommodate me with something special. I checked in with the host, the seated me right away as they were not busy.
Service
The service at this place does not meet an upscale restaurant service. They also do not do anything special for you like a decoration at the table or free desert if you have a special occasion even though they confirm that on the phone with you when you make a reservation.
Food
Starters
Ordered 2 appetizer dishes the tuna tartare and the Cheese Burata with mushrooms. The appetizers were the only thing that did stand out for the whole evening.
Main course
Ordered the ravioli with mushroom and the rigatoni with lamb. The rigatoni with lamb was a bit salty and did not meet my expectations. However , the ravioli with mushrooms was ok.
We finally decided to skip on dessert and call it a night. I would say that I was bummed that this place did not meet my expectations."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tejashree M.","This looked like an upscale restaurant with good ambience but the service I got was a bit disappointing. They left just a paper bill on my table without saying anything or asking for desserts. After asking, it took them forever to bring out the dessert. I was seated at a table in the bar section on a Thursday night.
The tapenade served with bread at the beginning was the only amazing item here. The gnocchi was okay and the tiramisu was decent."

I liked the food....ambience.. wine was nice.. beautiful.. vegetarian options are quite limited, I enjoyed the portion size. My chicken entree was yum.. couldn't complete the whole thing though ..ha ha ha. Overall a cool place for office parties and larger crowds. Service was good.. we were 20 plus people, everything was served on time. Salad & desserts are average."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Vivian L.","Our favorite tables are the corner booths away from the bar (17, 15, etc.), or, at the far end corner of the bar itself--away from the chaos but enough to people watch and talk over date nights.
Foods
First time? Get the rabbit, it's their best stable dishes here. I never liked rabbit before because it always tasted chewy and drenched in gravy (typical French style). Here, the rabbit is juicy, tender, and with seared flavorings similar to a deep fried quail thigh. A creamy pasta dish. My favorite part was the rabbit's heart as I love organ meats and feel American meat recipes don't call for them enough.
If you're lucky to catch them on their lamb shank special of the day, get it. $35 and large enough to share, though I did see the fellow next to us finished up his.
Dessert
If you love cannoli like my husband, then you should get the cannoli. He seems to really like it.
The bread pudding is good, warm, prepared well, and on the lighter side. It's not your typical American bread pudding drizzled in caramel topped with ice cream.
Service
Outstanding. From hostess to waiters to bartenders to floor manager. It feels like family coming here. Not your pizzeria family, but your upscale cousin's family, haha. Whatever the case, this place will cheer you up on a bad day or the very least, not ruin your good days.
Price
Very reasonably priced. You get your money's worth here. The free focaccia bread alone is worth a visit. They always give us extra to bring home :), it's yummy. And I here their happy hour is one of the best in town. Will have to check that out!
Atmosphere
Classy. Family. Fun. Romantic. Italian.
No kids. Great!
No pets, either.
Location
Street view is The Westin's parking garage and Mc Donald's. It's almost like you've found a hidden gem."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Judi W.","Came here with a good friend because we deserve a good meal after a long week of school AND it was a good excuse to try a new place due to Seattle Restaurant week.
ENVIRONMENT - Very very dim. I could barely make out the people's faces at far tables. It's a cozy setting and the place is quite narrow. But it was comfortable and snug in our booth.
FOOD -
Poached pear, mozzarella, with prosciutto - Simple appetizer which I thought was a good way to start a meal. I loved the combination of sweet (from the pear), creamy (from the cheese), and salty (from the prosciutto) flavor that were on the dish.
Italian sausage lentil soup - My friend got this one and I had a bit of it. It's quite sizable for an appetizer and there were good chunks of sausages in it. Good hardy flavor and it filled her up.
Squid ink risotto with baked salmon - I loved the risotto. It's a bit briny and salty from the squid ink but it was also creamy. One of my favorite parts of the meal was this. The salmon was also nice and tender. I overestimate my appetite sometimes so I thought this plate wouldn't fill me up, but it really did!
Chocolate torte - My friend got this one, and the presentation was nice! Simple and decorated with strawberries. The torte is a good amount and was rich in chocolate.
Cannoli - I thought it would be smaller, but it was pretty big! I was also stuffed at this point, so I was thankful the dessert wasn't too large. It was my first time having a cannoli so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it's very heavy on the cream and the pastry bit was crunchy and hard. I still enjoyed it though!
SERVICE - Made a reservation for 7:15PM and we did arrive on time, but had to wait around 20min before being seated which is fine but ideally, would have liked to be seated sooner since we did arrive before our reservation time. But then again, it was SRW so I know they were packed! Service was good though! Very attentive and would always check in to see how we were doing and gave us good descriptions of the food when we ordered them. A lot of the words, we didn't know (due to our lack of knowledge on foodology terms or lack of Italian) so it was super helpful that the waiter told us what the dish consisted of.
Overall, I would come back to try their regular menu. It is kind of tucked away and the environment and space is a bit too narrow for my comfort, but the food was decent and the service was really good!"
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nan F.","Updated review on 11/4:
They took one hour to sit us down (we were 4) even though we had reservations.
Then another hour to bring the food. I'm not kidding.
The quality of the food has diminished. And don't expect that the food will be consistent. I came back to eat something I like and in three occasions it was different. How is it possible? One day they add capers the other they remove them and make the sauce creamier (not good) and then the portions are a lot smaller but same price. I mean: come on.
I doubt I will be back. Making pasta is easy. How can someone ruin that?"
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tara L.","My family was coming into town to celebrate birthdays and wanted Italian food. I came across this place and was able to place a reservation for 14 people within 2 week's notice. I like how they included the addition of ""happy birthday"" along with my aunt's name on the menu.
When we arrived, we were seated very promptly. The waiter we had was very friendly and the service overall was great. I enjoyed the bread with an olive tapenade was very good and was offered before dinner. For an appetizer, we just ordered green beans which was cooked and very flavorful with lemon.
For entrees, I ordered the carbonara. I liked that the dish had pork belly instead of bacon or pancetta like most carbonara dishes. The pork belly was cooked well and added a nice crisp. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli special of the day, which was potato and mushroom ravioli. I personally think his dish was better and would definitely recommend their ravioli.
Overall, I would come back here especially for their happy hour deals. Their pastas are handmade, which is always a nice addition. This place is also a cute date night place or great for parties."

"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica M.","Best place for carbonara! I LOVE pasta and this Italian restaurant in Seattle has a really creamy and flavorful taste in their carbonara which I love. Right after you get your entree you may think that the portion is too small but it's mainly because they use a large plate. It ended up getting me super full I couldn't finish it all. I also got a cocktail, which is probably why I got full too quickly. Some of my other friends ordered different pasta dishes and some said they didn't like it. I guess it just depends on what you get.
I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and the server we had took care of us pretty well. His enthusiasm was great and he was very knowledgeable of the menu. They even customized our menus and labeled ""Happy Birthday"" and put the birthday girl's name on it! Definitely makes you feel special lol."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Latifa S.","Darn!!!
This place really went down hill. Such a shame. Everything went down. Had 2 extremely warm bottles of wine: even asked for ice. They kept it chill but it was the warmest wine. Seattle's been hot lately. And both bottles of wine tasted like they have been outside.
It wasn't as busy as it used to be in the past either. But our plates weren't cleaned off the table for a long while too. Should've set at the bar with Heidi! But we had a table. The tuna tartare was covered in onions. Way way more onions than there should be. Pasta was a ok too.
The worst was the wine. Warm bottles of wine!! Such a shame. I love this place. Haven't been back in a bit. But to see it go down in both food/wine and service is a bummer!!"
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thea W.","Where do I begin? My husband and I have been here twice, first for our engagement dinner and again for my birthday just a few days ago. The first time we hit up Happy Hour- super good deals on the bar menu and drink specials. The service was good and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered more than half the menu and were not disappointed by any of it- standouts were the ahi and the quality of the pasta. The server caught me staring at my hand and asked if I'd just gotten my nails done. Slightly embarrassed I told her We had just gotten engaged and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful and unique ring my (now) husband had put on my finger. She brought out a chocolate desert at the end of the meal, complete with a fantastic sparkler candle to help us celebrate. It was very special and memorable.
Our trip two days ago was for the full dinner service. We were a group of 6 and they gave us a beautiful semi-private room where we managed to order about half the menu- starting out with many entrees as share plates before settling on individual entrees. Everything was absolutely exquisite. I wanted a different setting for my cut of meat which she happily accommodated. Standouts were the pheasant gnocchi, the rack of lamb, and the filet. All the meat was cooked just perfectly. I'm not normally a pasta eater but the freshness and quality of this pasta is undeniably delicious.
The server was lovely, helpful and very knowledgeable about the wines (impressive, even to the mother of all wine snobs at our table). She was very attentive without being overly-present.
On top of ordering half the menu, we ordered 4 bottles of wonderful wine and every desert. I can't say enough good things about Barolo. It was the best birthday dinner I have ever had and we will definitely be back.o"
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Richard M.","We went to Barolo, with a large party of 12 or 13, to celebrate a birthday and we had a wonderful time. It does a very good job at catering to special occasions.
When reserving the large party, the staff asked what the occasion was and we told them it was for a birthday. We provided them with the name of the person and when we arrived they gave the birthday girl a ""commemorative"" menu with her name and the occasion the top.
The server was very friendly and patient. Our group came slightly late and we didn't feel rushed to order/get things going while we waited for late guests. He came to our name several times throughout the service to make sure we had everything that we needed. It was nice.
The ambiance is perfect for a date night or special occasion, with the dim lighting and slightly upscale decor. It's a place where you could definitely come in wearing jeans and a t-shirt and be accepted, but also come in wearing dress attire and not be over dressed either.
The service, like most Italian restaurants, started with bread and some sort of olive oil-based dipping sauce. It was a little sweet, not my favorite, but it wasn't bad. The bread was good though, it had a little salt on top which made it easy to come back for more. We were a bit disappointed that we weren't offered more after finishing what was brought to the table, though I suppose that would've asked for more.
Of the many items on the menu, I tried one of the daily specials, which was a Squid Ink Pasta in a Pesto Sauce with Scallops and Salmon Roe and the Spaghetti Carbonara.
It was the first time that I had tried Squid Ink Pasta and I really enjoyed it. The pasta was al dente and had a nice salty, umami, flavor that you don't get with regular pasta. The pesto was light and refreshing and paired well with the pasta. There were two large scallops, I could've went for another, because they were perfectly cooked. I did expect a bit more Salmon Roe - and expected it to be atop the pasta, but it was scattered around the plate. Each bit with the Roe has a wonderful salty flavor. It was an extremely umami experience, between the saltiness of the Roe, Parmesan in the Pesto and the pasta itself. I would definitely order this again.
The Carbonara was a classic Carbonara. It was rich, salty, creamy and smoky. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the saltiness and smokiness of the pork paired really well with the creaminess from the eggs. Very good Carbonara.
After the meal they came with a small cake and a sparkler for a candle. It was pretty cool and a nice way to celebrate.
Also, it has a pretty robust wine list as well. Plenty of by glass, half bottle or full bottle options.
All-in-all its a very good restaurant, perfect for a date night or special occasion.
The only real negative is that it's a little expensive, but you could argue that's the trade off for the ambiance and execution for a large party. That being said, Seattle is filled with so many terrific Italian restaurant that serve just as food, if not better pasta, for the same price or less. But, if you don't mind spending a little money, check it out."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer L.","I was here tonight for my birthday and I was very underwhelmed, my friends who came with me love Italian food and had no interest in this place at the end of the night. I will add that our server named Francisco was extremely rude and aggressive, he was pushing us to order quickly and was rude when we had any questions. Not only that but also he rushed us and he himself was rushed although it was not that busy. For such a large group as ours there should be more assistance and attentiveness given.
I will start with the PROS.
- This place is good for group and large parties especially when you're celebrating a birthday. They bring out a small dessert with a sparking candle on it and it's very special. (Picture below shows our own cake brought)
- the carbonara was very good!! And well made, it was buttery and had the right amount of salt ($23)
- one star was added for the ambiance and the romantic lighting
CONS:
- as stated earlier the waiter was extremely rude and distant, he brushed us off so much that everyone had to comment about it at the table (we do not normally speak of people like that)
- all the other dishes we had including the meat, lamb rag and the bread and appetizers were NOT GOOD.. there are definitely a lot better Italian places to fill the need for some good pasta and bread... this is not it.
This experience was low and I will not be eating here again, I think also the waiter ruined the night for us with his attitude. If you're going to eat here I think it's best to go for HH when the options are good for its prices. Also, you can expect quick service and for the waiter to brush you off more than you would for a sit down dinner with added gratuity."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Corey S.","My husband and I visited Barolo for dinner with our friends on a Thursday night during restaurant week. It's a perfect spot if you're celebrating a special occasion; the low lighting makes it very romantic, and the food is high quality and prepared beautifully.
For our first course, three of use ordered the English Green Peas Puree' and Guanciale, which was rich, creamy, and probably my favorite item the whole night. I'm pescatarian, so I was delighted when they told me they could make any of the 1st courses vegetarian (they kindly removed the Guanciale). The 4th member of our party ordered the Speck And Mozzarella, Poached Pear (without the speck), and loved it as well.
For our main courses, my husband and I both ordered the Cernia alla Livornese with heirloom tomatoes and squid ink risotto, which was divine. We especially loved the squid ink risotto; I was worried might taste fishy, but it was the perfect texture and savory flavor. One of our friends ordered the Wild Boar Tenderloin Honey with juniper chanterelles, and he absolutely loved his dish! My husband had passed on ordering the boar because he was worried it would be too gamey, but it was cooked to perfection (seared on the outside and rare on the inside), and ended us wishing he'd ordered the same dish. Our 4th friend ordered the Raviolone with kale ricotta and local pumpkin puree and also finished off her dish!
For dessert, I was the only one to request the Torta Salame di Cioccolato, and it was amazing! The other three ordered the Cannoli, which I tried and enjoyed as well.
Our waiter was fun and friendly and joked around with whom I think must've been the manager, as he visited our table at some point in the evening.
I only have a couple small critiques; the first being that was a little loud and I had some trouble hearing my friends who were sitting right next to me. It also took a little longer for our food to come out than I was expecting. Both of these can be chalked up to it being restaurant week and they were serving a higher volume of people than normal (which is a good thing!).
Overall, I highly recommend Barolo for a high quality, fine dining experience!"
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kalpana R.","The food here was overall 3.5 stars but the service left something to be desired for and hence rounding down to 3 stars.
I came here with a large group of colleagues and each of us ordered an entree and then we shared desserts. Some of us also got some beverages.They served us with bread and dip while we were waiting for the orders but that was never re-filled. Maybe that's the restaurant policy but the empty bread plates sat on the table for a long time which was weird and made us expect refills. One person was served a barely warm coffee which had to be sent back.
Our server told us to not look at the pictures on Yelp to decide what to order and that he would be the best person to consult if we had any questions about the dishes. This also was weird; I understand that restaurants make changes to dishes but outright telling us to not look at pictures was off-putting/patronizing. One of my colleague also asked if they could get their lunch earlier than others, which was also meet with another patronizing statement that it takes time to serve 10+ people. This might have been a misunderstanding that the server thought that they were asking for everyone's lunch to come out quickly but still the response could have been better.
Moving on to the food, my carbonara was great! It also was deceptively huge quantity; and I especially loved the pork belly. The other entrees had mixed reviews ranging from meh to not bad to decent. The tiramisu was also decent and so was the affogato, but the latter could have been better if they had added more ice cream and less of the whipped cream.
Overall, I might get food to-go next time but not dine-in because of the service."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","Ahh, Barolo. What a complicated relationship we have. How do you always lure me into your late night happy hour?
Barolo is - hands down - my favorite happy hour in Seattle. 50% off bar food with $20 bottles of wine (red, white, or rose) is an absolute steal. They also have an excellent wine list outside of the happy hour, but the $20 bottles are always nicely selected and good for table wine. Happy hour is 3 - 6 p.m., with late night happy hour 10 p.m. - midnight.
The complimentary bread with an olive tapenade is reason enough to come here. I don't know how they are sent tapenade from heaven, but they figured out a way to import it, apparently. Man, it's good.
BUT, here's the real reason I get drawn into Barolo: THE BAKED ESCARGOT. Not sure if you like escargot? Trust me, order it, because you will. You get 6 escargots (removed from the shell) baked in a little muffin tin-like ceramic dish, swimming in a delectable butter sauce. Perfect use for extra bread - eat that lil' snail and then soak the bread in one of those little slots full of butter-ous harmony.
Other favorites: the grilled calamari is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cheese plate is a crowd pleaser, especially if you have a not-so-adventurous friend with you. All of the pastas I have tried will hit that carb-sized hole in your heart (and stomach).
The location is intimate (read: the bar area is small) with a dark, but upscale, atmosphere. I have always enjoyed our servers and bartenders; very friendly and chatty. Note that it is next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so the early happy hour is PACKED Monday-Friday, so arrive early if you are looking to go then. In the summer, the small outdoor area is buzzing with Amazonians in search of the city's best happy hour, so it can be difficult to get a seat.
5 stars for happy hour, with a solid 4 for the rest of the time (the full menu is tasty in itself, albeit a bit rich). Even when I promise myself I am going to try another happy hour, I end up here - and always leave so happy, full, and ready to come back."

We went on a tip that their bar menu was half off all day on Sunday. The bar menu was full of diverse, large meals! You could enjoy a cheese plate, salad, burger, homemade pasta dishes or beef tenderloin. I enjoyed the rigatoni with beef and veal ragu! It was a hearty, delicious meal! I loved it! The only down side to the meal was the service. It was slow and rather inattentive. Even that, wouldn't keep me from going back and enjoying another great meal at Barolo!

"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katrina M.","Dinner with my husband tonight and we came here for the first time. Carrello made for a wonderful evening with a great setting and a great feel!
What is unique about their restaurant is the small plates they serve via rolling carts. We had heard about these and being a fan of trying many dishes, we came not knowing if you could make a dinner of these small offerings or not.
They offered about 10 small dishes throughout the time we were here and we had about 7 of them. They were all wonderful but they were small (some only $3-4 each but ranged to $11) and not enough to make a dinner. So we ordered a salad, a pasta and a fish (whole branzino) from the main menu as well. This was the perfect amount of food as the main menu dishes were small also. Total bill before tip was about $135.
Food was fantastic, loved it all. Pasta had a wonderful texture, but it was a small dish size as well. We had so many things that it is difficult to name them all. Fun place to go, especially if you like to try many things instead of one single entree."

The initial service is fantastic and the bread is to die for, however the pasta was overcooked, salad overdressed and the wait staff less than friendly.
Dessert yielded the worst semi Freddo ever. The cart concept is fantastic but fails to deliver on the food and ultimately provided an overall mediocre experience at a high cost.
I will not be returning here again."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nate H.","I'll be honest with you I wasn't that impressed just looking at the pictures of this place. It looked like a place where I would get a really small pasta dish and destroy my credit score doing so. Boy was I wrong... this place is fantastic.
Luckily for Carrello, my girlfriend convinced me to go to this place with her for our anniversary because she really liked the decorations (hanging plants bring the ladies in apparently). We were very impressed by the ambiance and the friendly service. You definitely get the chic hipster vibe when you're in here, so make sure you wear your finest beanie.
This place combines incredible pasta with a mini surprise dish at every turn. They give you a wooden block which signifies to the wait staff if you're in the mood for some Italian delicacies. As you're waiting for your dishes, they bring around all sorts of goodies from calamari, to fancy meatballs, or a massive tray of desserts.
The pasta itself made me want to kiss an Italian grandmother. We took the risk of getting a dish with tripe in it for the first time ever, and it paid off. I can't even remember what the name of the pasta was, but the blend of tripe and veal was so rich and creamy that I forgot I was eating a baby animals and stomach lining."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth L.","Tasty pasta, limited menu selection, $$$-$$$$. With its Altura lineage, the pasta at Carrello is delicious - absolutely recommend the agnolotti, pappardelle with oxtail, tripe, anchovy crumb, and gnocchi, all which were divine. We also enjoyed the spicy pan roasted brassicas (broccolini, cauliflower), despite the steep price at $17 for a veggie side.
Aside from the limited menu, Carrello features an Italian take on dimsum with small plates being offered on carts. The roasted beets were tasty but otherwise average, the lamb meatball similarly so. While we enjoyed the prosciutto, the portion was rather miniscule. Would pass on the cured veal. According to our server, roughly 14 snacks and small plates are offered on carts each night.
In full disclosure, we avoided the From the Table meat entrees, which were steeply priced - $59 for roasted whole fish, $125 for dry aged ribeye (would expect 4-star steakhouse at that price), $47 for whole roasted chicken, $59 for roasted lamb neck (wow!).
Portions are small, as reviews note, so prepare to spend $60-$70 pp. Highly recommend cocktails and pasta if you're curious about the Carrello experience!"
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mia Z.","Interesting that it's Italian/American in dim sum style, they push out carts around the place every 10 min, small plates so you get to taste a lot of appetizers. We had beef tartar(amazing), rabbit and pork meat balls(absolutely fantastic), beet salad(good).
Each cart has a number on there which represents the price of the item. Then they mark on the small sheet of paper on your table of what you get (like how dim sum works).
I highly recommend coming for the cart. The entree pastas are mediocre to me. We will be back for only cart."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sheryl K.","Recently tried this place and I can't wait to go back and try more things!
The concept of the restaurant is really similar to dim sum where people come around with carts of food and mark off what you select on a note card. However, this experience was probably a lot better than going to a dim sum restaurant because they don't pressure you and push you to buy food! I guess you can say it's Italian cuisine with the dim sum cart concept.
I can't remember what we picked up from the carts and what we ordered through our server, but everything was very delicious. My only negative comment is that some dishes were pretty spicy but I'm super weak sauce with spicy food. So if you're a normal person that can handle mildly spicy to pretty hot foods, you'd love it. My entree had a slight kick, which was ok-ish for me. I would've preferred no kick/no spice at all, but that's just me. But ate all of it because it was that tasty!
So if you're looking for an Italian restaurant that has a fun ordering experience, I highly recommend coming to try this place out. I'm definitely ready to come back and try more!"
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jacqueline D.","We got a reservation here on Tuesday night for a girls night. Surprising that we were able to make the reservation a few days prior, but I imagine it'll be harder as Carrello gets more and more well known.
Such a cool concept - you can order a bunch of food from a menu - large meat plates, pasta and apps.., and while waiting or eating, there are carts w/ smaller tapas size portions being pushed around that you can also order off of (imagine dim sum but make it italian). These range from $3-$12 and is super fun to supplement your main meal!
We also had some great wine - they do have a sommelier if you need additional help/recs to pair the right wine with your meal!
One of our group members was vegetarian, and although they don't have a ton of veg specific items, most menu items can be made vegetarian with fantastic substitutes, where it didn't feel like a substitution/customized dish!
Everything we tried was delicious - from the apps, to small plates to pasta... great flavors and honestly afterwards made me excited for my next visit!!!"
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sara C.","I hate to review this because I know it's going to get harder and harder to snag reservations here, but they deserve it.
We heard from friends that the pasta is the way to go here, so we ordered three pastas - their gnocchi, agnolotti and chittara - and then ordered a few things from the different small plate carts.
The verdict - not only was the pasta SO good but the carts made it a really fun experience as well. Not to mention these small plates were VERY decently priced. For example, we got two plates of prosciutto and coppa for $3 EACH.
We really, really loved this place and would definitely want to come back again. I think the prices were just fine for the quality and experience."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sara A.","I came across Carello when walking past it looking for a place to eat in the area. They have an interesting concept that I really appreciated. You order your entrees (larger and for the table to share--can take 40-60 mins) plus smaller dishes. They have carts going around throughout the evening with smaller bites you can share. They place a card on your table with number on it and and this number corresponds to the numbers on the cards with the small bites as well as the price of that particular item. Items on the carts vary daily.
We weren't too hungry so we got the beef and veal spaghetti, the brassicas (cauliflower mix), and bread and picked up fried artichoke hearts from one of the carts. I loves the spaghetti. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was on point. Not overly spicy, but very flavorful. The brassicas were on the spicy wide, but more like too many spices were used as opposed to hotness. It was a little overwhelming. We also munched on some bread which is served with olive oil and butter as an appetizer. The artichoke hearts were also delicious.
Overall, I had a great experience here and loved the food. The plates they have for the table did seem a bit overpriced for what they were though. Pastas and smaller sides were more reasonable."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Latifa S.","Opening night meal!
I've already been a big fan of Altura for a while, naturally I'd have to check out their new venture too. This place came up rather fast for a new spot. The old place closed down, chef Nathan took over! And viola! It's a whole new spot!
The menu was simple enough. Carts of items with prices on it: like dim sum but Italian style. Rabbit meatball, grilled octopus, hamachi crudo, grilled peppers, desserts etc. You pick what you want. And contorni/ salads/bread, pasta and meat/seafood. Meat and seafood dish take about 45-60 minutes to come out so order accordingly.
We had the octopus with lentil, chicory salad, grano with crab and rock shrimp, tagliatelle with anchovy oil and tonno (tuna heart). And the rosemary lemonade and red wine!
The octopus was amazing and delicious. Tiny bite sizes, spicy pepper. Just great. Pasta portions are much smaller than small portions. The tagliatelle was delicious: even had some kale in it? The grano sauce was good but pasta itself was undercooked. We like al dente in our Italian family but this was much undercooked. Would've been great to try a better cooked version.
The chicory was a ok as well. Overall, I was just excited to be here and trying the new concept from my old favorite spot. Cart concept was good but once you missed a cart, it took forever to come back. Some don't even come back. We missed the octopus first time around and got it almost an hour later. Since it's a cart item, you can't order it. Same with mussels. And dessert!
Our server was super friendly. Took about 35-40 minutes to get our bill and pay though. They got busy at the end, it got slow. Same with the carts: once you miss one, it takes forever to get it back since they remake it. . I'm a small eater and left hungry. Overall, 3.5 stars for opening night. But since I can't do .5, I'm rounding it up."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kelley J.","Very solid spot, was pleasantly impressed. Despite many comments, can be very reasonably priced based discretionary orders- don't go loco w/ the carts."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mimi T.","After dining at Altura recently, I was more than happy to find out about Carrello. We decided to come here for an anniversary celebration and the experience didn't disappoint! I've been to one other restaurant (that's not dim sum) that also specializes in traveling carts of food, but the first Italian one.
As for the food, you start with ordering the non-cart items (but if you're like us, we decided to pick a few small items from the carts as it came by first).
+PUMPKIN: We decided to order a contorni (vegetable side dish) and we were so happy to go with this one. The incredibly soft and almost creamy pumpkin (kind of reminded me of sweet potatoes) came topped with hazelnut butter and crispy guanciale! It was the perfect sweet and salty dish! Just to note, my boyfriend doesn't like pumpkin but this might've been one of our favorite dishes here!
-PARSNIP GNOCCHI: I think I just wasn't expecting this one. It's not quite a fluffy gnocchi (maybe because it's made of parsnip?) and came with bits of boar.
-GRANO ARSO RAVIOLI: This was the crab ravioli (came with 3). For this one, I also wasn't used to the pasta dough - it didn't really have the chewiness I normally like in pasta. It was almost stiff. But the broth it came with was deliciously light!
Of these menu items, I think I'd be hesitant to order more of the pasta - they weren't necessarily bad, just not my favorite pasta texture.
As for the cart items, I have to say that I'm the type of person that loves tapas and small dishes, so we definitely focused more on these. The cart items range from $3 upward and each cart has 2-3 items. For dessert, you tell them that you're done with the meal and someone will come out with a cart of all the dessert options!
+DUCK MOUSSE: This was definitely my favorite but I'm a sucker for liver mousses. Oh, and also the crackers were fried in duck fat - no biggie! The dish also came with cranberries on top (loved the tartness to cut the fat).
+BEEF CRUDO: Just so good. The cracker actually reminded us of the exact same crackers from Altura!
+FRIED DOUGH: Okay, can you really go wrong with fried dough? It was only $3, greatly seasoned and went amazingly with the salami.
+SALAMI: Delicious! A pretty good portion that you can also see them slicing in the middle of the restaurant!
+CELERY SALAD WITH ANCHOVY: This looks and sounds so simple but it was delicious! Don't skip out on it!
+LIMONCELLO SEMIFREDDO: Didn't really taste like limoncello to me but it was scrumptious nonetheless! The berries on the bottom were great too!
All in all, I think you get the Altura flavors without the high price tag (though I wouldn't say this is a cheap meal - though worth it!). The service is great and the staff are incredibly friendly! All in all, would definitely return!"
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Grace C.","This is the pasta place that tried too hard and failed. Tl;dr- get the bread. The pasta is just normal pasta dishes with fancy additions that miss the mark completely.
To start we ordered the bread, potatoes and carrots to share. Two items off the dim sum carts. We each ordered our own pasta- I ordered the tagliatelle for myself.
The homemade bread for $8 is no joke. This is the best bread ever. It's soft and squishy in the middle and the crust has this crunch that is so delicious- it might be the only time I enjoyed the crust more than the inside. The bread alone is 5/5 stars and I am coming back for the bread.
The potatoes were nice- better than the carrots. The potatoes seemed to be double fried and has their own mayo and a sea of sage but so good. The carrots were ok- there's a little bit of bacon in the ocean that is peanuts and it has a tinge of sweetness that was kind of weird.
Off the dim sum cart we got a fried dough and some of the charcuterie- each $4 and not worth it. The fried dough was weird and bland. And to have the charcuterie wrapped around it (as suggested) did not enhance anything for me except the lament that I was down $8.
And the tagliatelle. What's disappointment. It looks nice in the pics- trust me- but it's topped with a giant mount of tuna in hopes to differentiate it from the normal spaghetti aglio e olio. The waiter recommended I mix in the tuna to make it less fishy but then I basically was eating an overly oily aglio e olio. Binging with babish would be disappointed with the amount of olive oil left over.
In short. Not coming back except for the wine and bread. The third star is for the bread."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin Z.","Dining at a higher price point (which typically means small portions) can be a fantastic experience when done right. Carrello simply had too many misses for me to be a worthwhile experience for how much it cost.
We started with some bread and fried potatoes. This was the best course of the meal. The bread had a lovely char and was accompanied by some warm butter. Biting into the buttered bread was like crispy heaven. The potatoes were also crispy and well cooked, though the cooks went a little too crazy on the fried sage.
We then got a bunch of pasta to share, many of which had crispy fish flakes on top. While I understand that adding fish flakes or fish sauce can add a lot of umami to a dish, there was simply too much on our pasta which made it taste really fishy and unappetizing. I personally ordered the tagliatelle with tripe. Pasta was cooked well but I felt that the texture of the tripe really ruined the dish. The weird dim sum carts kept coming around the whole time. We ordered some small dishes but weren't really that impressed.
Overall I think I won't be returning for a second meal. The food was only OK and the atmosphere felt unnecessarily pretentious."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phil G.","Carrello, I am constantly forgetting the name, was too much fun. The food was good too! We sat at the liquor bar to eat and immediately struck up conversations with the patrons and the engaging bartender named Firenze. My wife, the true foodie, ordered the food while I gabbed and posed. The pastas were fantastic as was everything else I ate. We ordered too much, as is our wont, and everything tasted wonderful. Everyone at Carrello was smiling, and this is a happy place to be.
The mother restaurant to Carrello is just across the street named Altura. It is a gastronomic destination with an expensive degustation menu. Carrello is the perfect counterpart, with its casual, boisterous vibe. Prices were reasonable but the experience made money irrelevant. A great time is priceless."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tracie D.","Sits On the end of busy broadway street. My first time here and id have to say I'm very impressed. Staff is very nice especially the bartender!
Im fairly picky on my rating for YELP and overall food experience. But this place has been exceptional!
We had the spaghetti , ravioli, duck pasta , another dish was baked vegetables (sorry forgot the name which was amazing btw) and the fish entree. ALL WELL CRAFTED.
What caught me by surprise was the ""cart"" serving small tasters of their foods which doesn't happen much in seattle restaurants which is a nice surprise
The food options aren't huge but does make up in taste. Would have to say price is on the high end for portion size. If you were to come alone and wanted a ""meat"" dish it would be impossible to finish.
Id like to see smaller options for less. Which would be nice for bar areas seating when you're there for a quick bite. Cause pasta size is on point for single servings."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Liz J.","Service was definitely off. We got there 15 mins early and they made us wait until exactly 7:30 before we were seated, and they had a number of empty tables. They had a number of carts going around with apps/small plates, but half of the carts just went by our table and they didn't even tell us about what was on it. And we were looking at the servers directly since we were hungry.
When we finally did get our first item, no one had stopped by our table to even take a drink order. Which was a shame because I would have liked a glass of wine with the cured meats we got.
Food was delicious, we ordered 2 vegetable dishes and 3 pastas and enjoyed them all immensely. Unfortunately they were all brought them to us all at the same time. All 5 plates for a small table of 2. So we barely had enough room to fit it all in. And then we had to eat really quickly before the food got cold. We each got a glass of red which went wonderfully with each dish we got. Also the fork they give you has kind of wierd dimensions? Made it really difficult to use at times to cut items, as knives were not given.
Hoping these things improve, the food was delicious. When we did interact with the wait staff they we're very friendly."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Vijay B.","Nathan Lockwood is, without a doubt, Seattle's best chef and his first restaurant - Altura - is Seattle's best restaurant. Here's my review for Altura:
yelp.com/biz/altura-seat…
If you don't know the history, Altura used to be mostly a la carte. Eventually Lockwood switched to a prixe fixe menu to showcase his culinary talents (which, if Michelin ever came to Seattle, would be amply rewarded) but that had a downside. Many of the favorite a la carte menu items were jettisoned much to the chagrin of his regular patrons. When this was brought up with Lockwood, he mentioned that he had a project in mind to create a second restaurant that would reprise these great dishes (especially the exquisite pasta dishes).
It was several years in the making and having found a perfect location, just across the street from Altura in the old Poppy space, Lockwood has opened Carrello to much fanfare. In a way Carrello feels like the old Altura in a larger space, with some extra quirks. The menu features the amazing pasta dishes that old patrons of Altura had grown to know and love but he has also added a sort of Italian dim-sum quality to the service.
Servers will periodically bring around carts with various delictations concocted by Lockwood, such as duck liver mousse from which diners can choose, if they wish, a taste. In this way Carrello allows diners to have both the a la carte experience with something of a tasting menu feel.
It goes without saying, the food is exceptional. One would expect nothing less from Lockwood, and the space is quite nice. It doesn't quite have the homey feel that Altura does and is a little spartan (I hope in time they can spruce it up a bit), but it's certainly a nice place for a lovely dinner with that special someone.
If you love high end northern italian cuisine, you must try Carrello."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carolyn P.","We tried Carrello for a date night and could not have been happier. There is something truly delightful about the little carts that come around. We opted to pick and choose from the carts and order two pasta dishes to share. It was more than enough food, and I can see how you could make an entire meal from the cart snacks alone...and I just might do that in the near future. It was an incredible variety of items and I was impressed that each one seemed more delicious than the last. Definitely book a reservation if you don't want to wait or be disappointed."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Neiha A.","Excellent food!! One of my new favorite Italian restaurants in town. We were sitting right at the bar ( really friendly bartender.) We had vegetarian dishes Scarpinocc pasta and Farinata baked chickpea, OMG!! The flavors were outstanding.
For dessert I got the chocolate olive oil cake with caramel and hazelnut brittle, that was outstanding!!! My husband got the Cannoli which was ok.
Altura( across the street) is also owned by Nathan Lockwood. I haven't tried that, and it's on my list.
Overall great experience at Carrello, awesome food and ambience. I will go back for sure."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dave C.","So very glad this outstanding restaurant has settled into the historic Homestead Cabin just off Alki Beach.
We've had three meals now, no easy feat given the intense demand for reservations since they opened last summer. They all were among the very best we've had in Seattle. The pasta dishes change frequently and are all beautifully textured and popping with fresh fresh flavors, perfectly sauced. The antipasto are mostly light and bright; I have no idea how they source such extraordinary ingredients in the dead of winter. And the primi & secondi are all prepared so perfectly (so far) - the ribeye with a light, crispy crust containing stunning fatty bursts with each bite - the lamb beautifully prepared with the most delicately fruity/minty sauce - the black cod or salmon also beautifully sauced.
Service is elegantly casual, and the selection of wine is wonderful. Cocktails are also so well prepared.
I have no idea how this place is rated only 4 stars - this place is of the caliber of Salare, Cafe Juanita, and Canlis."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joline T.","TL;DR Chef makes the simple things shine
Reservations: Seriously prohibitive and a pain. Reservations are open 30 days at a time. Reservations open at midnight. Had to book a month out at 12:01 am.
Parking: There's a lot right next door to the building. Signs will say parking for Homestead only; that's for Il Nido at the Homestead.
Burrata and prosciutto: Burrata was incredibly fresh and light, prosciutto was beautifully delicate and perfectly salty paired with the fresh burrata. Hands down the best prosciutto I've ever had.
Tagliatelle with bolognese: Tagliatelle was a little more al dente than I've had at other places; I loved the chew. I hate to compare it to Il Corvo, but how do you not? I also haven't been to Il Corvo for a couple years now because the line is impossible now. Based on my v distant memory, Il Corvo was just as good for half the price. But since I can't get Il Corvo anymore, then I'll pay for chef's pasta at Il Nido.
Cauliflower steak: it was fine. Gorgonzola was an interesting pairing that I've never had before. Gorgonzola wasn't overwhelming, but it was too much for me. That's a very personal taste thing though.
Pork cheeks with dried pear slices and polenta: Pork cheeks were didnt-need-a-fork tender. The sweetness of the pear complemented the earthiness of the pork cheeks. The polenta was the best I ever had. Crispy on the outside, fluffy soft the inside. Nice cheese flavor without being cheesy.
Would def come back!"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Parisa E.","Il Nido is truly what an Italian experience should be! Cozy, fresh, and wanting more!
Getting reservations are tough (1 month in advance and opens at midnight). Once you dine there the hostess will ask if you want to make more reservations so we made 2 more 3-4 months in advance. I thought this was a really nice touch making them value their customers!
Food was amazing and pasta was cooked perfectly! I was really surprised and amazed by the desert both the taste and presentation! The log cabin is so cozy and perfect for a night out!"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sylvia K.","We were able to snag last minutes reservations for two on the Resy site on the day of (there was a cancellation!) at 8pm. We've been wanting to eat at Il Nido for months since it opened. The Resy site was easy to use and we got an email confirmation plus a text reminder an hour before our reservation.
We arrived a few minutes early (there's a small parking lot but we easily found street parking - Alki in winter is a lot less busy) and the host seated us right away. The historic Alki Homestead building has been beautifully restored. The interior is gorgeous and because it's December there were Christmas decorations which was lovely.
Our server Chad came over and told us the special (which was a cheese plate) and gave us some time to look over the menu. Everything on the menu sounded good. We decided on the special cheese plate (which came with a soft cheese from Cowgirl Creamery), the sage pappardelle in rabbit sugo, and the cider braised pork cheek. We asked the server to recommend a wine to go with our dinner and he suggested the arneis.
The arneis wine was lovely and paired well with our food. The cheese plate was yummy - the cheese was good and the housemade quince paste was delicious. Our pasta dish was my favorite part of the meal. The sage pappardelle was amazing and cooked perfectly. The rabbit meat was tender (and plentiful) and the sauce was light tasty. The pork cheek was also delicious and the flavor was great and the meat was also really tender (didn't even need a knife!). This polenta cake came with the pork cheek and that was super salty. Not sure if they just added too much salt or they added enough salt but didn't account for the polenta soaking up additional sauce, but it was way too salty.
Overall, the meal was delicious - the pasta and the proteins were good and the service was excellent, and the ambiance was perfect. I loved the log cabin interior and the christmas decorations. The only reason I couldn't give a full five stars was because of the overly salty polenta cake. For the prices and for the difficulty of getting reservations, I would expect all the food to be perfect. I'll definitely come back for the pasta (if we can somehow get reservations again)!"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jacqueline H.","I was so excited to go to Il Nido because I am a huge Il Corvo fan. It's a bit difficult to make reservations, but was able to get a table for a Thursday night. The restaurant is in a very cute log cabin-esque venue and is super cozy when you go inside. Service was amazing the whole night and they even took our coats and bags when we sat. They have different specials each night, which is introduced by the server who was very helpful and checked in multiple times throughout our meal. We tried the bruschetta, which is delicious and fatty - I would recommend getting a salad as an appetizer though because it'll help balance out the carbs later. We also ordered the ragu pasta and pesto pasta. I think these are always on the menu, but they were both delicious and perfectly cooked, much like at Il Corvo. Lastly, we ordered the tiramisu, which honestly was not that good. I wouldn't order it again. Despite that, the rest of the food was incredible and service was top notch. Would highly recommend coming in, especially if you want a high quality dining experience!"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","I am behind in my Yelp reviews coming up on one year, however, despite that sleep eludes me, I am compelled to post a Yelp review for Il Nido (10/9/19).
Big fan of pretty much whatever project Chef Mike Easton, his wife Victoria, and their team are involved in....from the early days of Bizarro, Lecosho, and when Il Corvo was sharing space with a gelato shop at the Pike Place Market Hillclimb. Well before those infamous weekday lines on James between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.
Since I'm a northender and work way up in North Lynnwood for 4.5 years, it is rare to have that amazing bowl of pasta, that kale salad, the proscuitto/pickled celery plate, selection of olives, and/or the delicious shortbread cookies from Il Corvo.
There are plenty of other worthy sites all over the city, but with traffic, parking, budget, and other logistics, sometimes having amazing hand crafted pasta takes major strategic planning.
I was among the masses awaiting the restoration of the Alki Homestead and the opening of Il Nido. Wasn't among the first to dine in mid May though and regretfully had to cancel a reservation in June. Then to learn it's booked a month or so out, are you f-ing kidding me?
Spring and summer flies by. Autumn is well underway with the colorful foliage and brisk breeze.
On a whim, turned my attention to the Resy site yesterday to see if I can nail a unicorn reservation to Il Nido. I literally had to blink in disbelief at six available slots for today. Time to check it out, and see why Yelp reviews run the entire spectrum, and why the wide disparity?
I left my home with a two hour cushion to make that trek to West Seattle. Not bad, in 30 minutes I was exiting off the bridge onto Harbor Avenue. Beautiful views of the water and the downtown Seattle skyline, I periodically stopped to admire and photograph. Located Il Nido (see posted tip) and a parking space right out front, then basked in the sun.
They don't unlock the main entrance until 5pm sharp. So I had an opportunity to admire the building exterior and well kept garden beds, plus chat with a trio of other women seated at the front bench. More folks also started appearing on the porch. Nice and orderly we all entered, thankfully no Black Friday-like pushing and shoving.
Once inside taking it all in, very aesthetically pleasing, and an amazing interior restoration. I had a brief flashback to two Willows Inn visits with the similarities of welcoming warmth, natural light, and lots of focal points.
Checked in at the host stand and was promptly brought to a two top, where I was taken care of by Chad and his other Il Nido colleagues. I was pleased to learn that the seasonal menu recently had changed, but passed on this evening's special of rabbit. ""Thumper"" at Cafe Juanita nearly two decades ago still gives me PTSD.
So here's the run down of what I indulged in:
*Rubicon ($14) Bourbon, black walnut bitters, fig sugar, on the rocks. Nice strong and smooth cocktail.
*Contorni ($11) Mixed chicories salad with anchovy dressing, perfectly soft boiled egg, and copious parmigiano atop. Wish the greens weren't quite so cold temperature wise, but ate about a third with the egg. Kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Primi Pasta ($24) Lumache, winter squash cream, crisp fried sage, and cookie dust. Delicious seasonal pasta. This is where others balk at either the pasta prices, quantity, or both. I ate half with all the sage leaves. Again, kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Secondi Bistecca Ribeye ($49) requested medium rare and served atop tender salad greens. The juices on the greens were spot on tasty. I was blown away by the quality, preparation, and presentation of the ribeye steak. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, tender...barely didn't need the steak knife provided. Again, ate half with all the salad greens. Yes, another box filled.
*Savored the ribeye with a glass of 2016 Avennia Gravura ($16/glass) a full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc from Columbia Valley. The pour definitely complemented the steak.
*For dessert, Espresso with biscotti ($3) and the Chocolate Salami dessert special ($10) added the exclamation point to my dinner. Slices of chocolate speckled with ladyfingers to mimic the salami, served in addition with hazelnut brittle, plum and apple slices, and a berry compote. Nicely composed, not cloying, and terrific flavors and textures.
I enjoyed my brief exchanges with the wait staff throughout my meal and the host staff upon departing. I dined alone, but was well attended to and the entire meal was well paced.
Il Nido is an impressive neighborhood gem, fresh seasonal items showcased from local purveyors, spot on professional service, contributing to an overall, thoroughly enjoyable dining experience."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Huong L.","I was super excited about this place when i first heard about it. I even woke up at like 3am to try to get reservations... I guess my expectation was too high that it was kind of a let down...
The place itself is very rustic and homey so it was a mix between being casual and fancy.
As you get seated, your server comes over to explain the menu as it change frequently, which is nice. We ended up getting following:
the special of the day which is a papadel noodle with a rabbit ragu - the pasta here is the same as il corvo - perfectly cooked, great flavors, but 2-3x more expensive than il corvo...
the quail wrapped with bacon - this was a very well balanced dish, the quail wrapped in bacon was cooked perfectly, and it was savory and rich, which was balanced out by some vibrant greens and plums.
braised green dish - did not expect this dish to be so southern style. It was kinda heavy and more beans than braised green, also kinda bland.
Poached pear in red wine with crumble - pretty good. You get a nice surprise when you cut the pear open as it is filled with cream. Also very light and not super sweet.
In summary, the food was ok, some good, some ok, but nothing extraordinary. The pasta was perfect but I rather wait at il corvo as it is cheaper and you can get more options. The wait for food here was almost as long which confuse me because they have an idea of how many people will be here through reservation so I don't know why it took so long for food to come out (it took almost 30 minutes for our dessert!)
The highlight of my meal??? The little biscotti sample they gave at the very end. It was probably the best biscotti I ever eaten. But they gave us 1.5 bitr pieces for 2 people...not sure what that is about either .."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia C.","We were so excited to get a reservation here because of all the hype.
A little underwhelmed, nothing was bad but wouldn't say anything was amazing either. Pastas were all cooked perfectly, the bucatini was definitely our favorite dish. I would say it is worth checking out as I believe their dishes change continuously based on the seasons. Glad we came and tried Il Nido, it was worth the trek to West Seattle ;)"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julie P.","Great atmosphere, good service & delicious food! I'm a fan!
Everything we tried here was very good but the only thing that was a little disappointing was the portion was a bit lacking compared to other Italian restaurants, especially because it is on the pricier side.
We got the Castelvetrano Foccacia Bread to start off (unfortunately, bread does not come with the meal hahah) but man, it was worth paying for it because it was delicious.
We also tried the Rigatoni Nero & the Wild Boar Tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was cooked to perfection! It was so good - I think this was my favorite dish! The Rigatoni Nero lacked sauce - the pasta was a bit dry, but I did like that there was a lot of octopus in the dish. The Wood-grilled Saddle of Lamb was really yummy but it was pretty small! Haha I must have been super hungry. We finished our meal with Tiramisu dessert! My all time favorite and it did not disappoint!
Overall, I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place at least once! I will definitely come back for special occasions - IF we can get a reservation! They book out months in advance... We got super lucky and came here on the week of their opening because my friend ending up giving me her reservation! :) Thanks Il Nido - we had a great experience here."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca T.","My boyfriend was able to snag us a table at il Nido the day of after waiting on the waitlist for a while- so don't give up!!
I am a huge fan of il corvo so of course when I heard about il nido opening up, I desperately needed to try it! The menu seemed to have rotated recently so I have the updated menu below!
For starters we ordered the chicories salad and bruschetta al lardo. Both were absolutely delicious! Fair warning, the chicories salad was pretty bitter so if you don't like bitter tastes don't get it! The bruschetta was sooo good. The bread was very fresh & the butter was so creamy!
For pastas, we ordered the rigatoni with braiseed beef & the bucatini with pork. The pasta was cooked very al dente just like how they do it over at il corvo. The beef sauce was pretty heavy and packed full of flavors. There were big beef chunks in it too! The bucatini had little pork pieces and was definitely a lot less strong but still very flavorful as well. I'm glad I was able to have a little of both for some balance. The pasta portions were the same as il corvo's!
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was pretty good (nothing special though!)"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Silvia V.","Amazing place!!
Reservation recommended if you want to sit in the restaurant or there is a small bar for 2-people party. Without reservation you may have to wait for a while.
The food: delicate, flavorful, and beautiful! We had wine and a full menu with appetizers, entrees (lamb and pasta), dessert and coffee. Really great!
Service: impeccable! Friendly host and nice waiter.
Price: totally appropriate for the quality you get. It is on the fancy date side but definitely worth every penny!
Atmosphere: calm and perfect for conversations!
Just an outstanding place and a gem in the area!!
Thanks for the beautiful experience!

"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Laura C.","A bit of a let down compared to Il Corvo. In general, expectations were very high coming to this restaurant hoping the pasta would be the same as their lunch spot.
The meal was quite unmemorable, but I remember the dishes being very small and the pastas not living up to what they serve at Il Corvo. For what you pay in price, I would expect a bit more from Il Nido."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Robyn C.","Went here for opening night with high expectations. I knew the pasta was going to be great, but I had one question... is it worth it? Yes. The service was great. Our server actually engaged with us about the menu rather than just telling us ""the special"" and the usual ""thanks for joining us"".
Small menu but, the dishes were well executed.
The octopus rigatoni was 5/5!! A heaping portion of baby octopus, pasta and oh man- the spices. I try not order squid, octopus or even scallops at restaurants because it tends to be over cooked, but I'm really glad I gave it a go! Also tried the trout. The olives and the fennel really enhanced the flavor of the fish.
Then came the tiramisu. It wasn't as ""soaked"" as I would've liked, which made the flavor more like just any other ""coffee cake"". I wasn't so sure about the chocolate garnish because it just ended up bigger than the actual tiramisu... was it supposed to be a shell? I'm not sure.
All in all, it was good food. The ocean view near by isn't so bad either."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Emily J.","When the reservations opened for Il Nido, I immediately jumped on resy to book for a weekend night. Looking back on it, I am glad I did because when I was debating moving it, all the reservations for June were taken.
Having been to Il Corvo one time before, I kinda knew what I was getting myself into by going here. If you are unfamiliar with their style, which I assume you aren't since you are on their yelp page, you now know what type of menu they have and what their dishes look like.
The prices are not low. I would not come here on a budget or thinking you are going to get quantity or quality. You are going here for the quality.
Reviewing the menu, each dish seems thoughtfully put together and you can see that in the presentation as each of your items gets placed onto your table.
For my date night, we started off with a drink. I asked for a fruity suggestion and ended up ordering the Cool Waves. It was definitely fruity, somewhat strong, and very tasty.
For the appetizer, we ordered the burrata and the 24 month prosciutto. If you have never had a burrata before, it is a fresh Italian milk cheese. When you see it, you probably are thinking rich and dense but it is actually what I would consider light, clean, and subtle. A very delicate flavor in my opinion. If you cannot handle dairy or are not a fan of milk, maybe skip it, otherwise I would recommend. The prosciutto was kinda gamey? A unique taste and little on the salty side.
The main course items we chose were the ricotta cavatieddi, roman style pomodoro and the wood grilled saddle lamb, corona beans, charred spring onions, peas. I, obviously, chose the pasta. It was exactly what I was expecting. Really good and I could of ate a huge portion of it. It was the perfect size if you had an appetizer before. If you did not, you would probably consider it small. The wood grilled saddle lamb was delicious. It melt in your mouth and had great flavor. The beans on the other hand, were just okay.
Overall, the meal was good but pricey. If you need to eat a ton, be ready to open up your wallet. Would I go back? Definitely! But only if other people wanted to go.
Parking - They do have a few spaces on the left, if you are driving by and facing the restaurant. They seem like they are normally open if you have either the 5pm or 5:30 pm reservation. If you have a later reservation, fingers crossed that you get a spot or else you get the joy of driving around alkai looking for street parking."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kirstie C.","I basically love everything about this place from the location, the architecture, mood/ambiance, decor, and especially the food.
Love that they tie in seasonal items to their menu along with specials that change so you get a good variety to choose from. I definitely recommend this spot and will be going back for sure."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ben C.","I haven't look forward to a restaurant opening since I lived in Washington DC about two years ago. Il Nido is the sit-down restaurant cousin of the famed Il Corvo walk-up Italian lunch spot in Pioneer Square.
I've followed the restaurant's development on Instagram and I have to say that it's one of the most beautifully designed and spacious restaurants that I've been to. Maybe it's just because they're getting a feel for running operations and don't want to overwhelm themselves but I appreciate not having to trip over chairs walking around the main dining area.
The menu consists of a handful of appetizers, four pasta dishes, a selection of salads, and three 'secondi' main dishes. The chef handmakes each pasta that goes on the night's menu-- the wheat berries used to make the cornetti were even toasted prior to grinding.
The focaccia was quite possibly even better than the one at Il Corvo-- for the first time in my life I actually ate an olive and enjoyed it. The staff encourage you to share dishes family-style so as to get enough of a taste of everything. All pasta was amazing, but I found a couple of the dishes to be served a bit colder than I would have hoped for. The dessert was out of this world good-- the tiramisu was utterly delicate and the panna cotta made me roll the eyes into the back of my head.
I'm really excited for this restaurant and am super interested to see how it develops over the coming years!"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Maddie E.","Is this place all it's cracked up to be? Yes, and then some. I've been lucky enough to come here twice in the past three months. Getting a reservation is tough and you have to be flexible with your dates/times, even if that means eating dinner at 9pm. The service is absolutely five stars and the ever-changing menu brings new surprises each visit. Can't wait for my next trip in February!"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Audrey C.","I cannot believe how difficult it was to get reservations here... I literally had to check back almost every day to see if anyone had cancelled and it still took a couple weeks. In the end we had a great experience and the food was delicious, but definitely on the pricier side for West Seattle. That said, given how busy this place is, I think there is plenty of demand for a littler pricier dining in West Seattle. I mean, how many more pizza places do we need?
We ordered a bottle of wine, two drinks, two pastas, burrata & 24 month prosciutto, focaccia, lamb, and tiramisu, and that was plenty and bit overkill for the two of us. But if you wait for that long to try a place, you might as well try as much as you can. I think our bill ended up being $260 including tip, so I would put it on the special occasion list or a couple times a year list. There are some lower priced Italian options in West Seattle that offer some pretty decent handmade pasta as well, but this place seemed like a level above and the service was really good.
Overall, will definitely be back to try it out again once things have died down a bit and reservations are easier.
Note- there is a bar which I assume is walk-up and you can order off their main menu, but can't confirm. There were a limited number of seats at the bar, maybe 8-10"
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tuan N.","I'll preface this by saying it's more like 3.5*
We've been waiting for this place to open up seeing how much we loved Il Corvo, but tough to make it there only during lunches.
With Il Nido open for dinner, we can have more of a chance to have delicious pasta.
First off the building, decor was welcoming like a home and service was on point from the greet to sit down. Our server was honest about the food and gave suggestions about what he thought were the stars and which dishes might needs to be tweaked.
We had the bruschetta, king oyster mushroom, and two different pasta and a couple of drinks.
The bruschetta came with a lard spread that was delicious but the bread was so burnt, they actually took it off our bill and gave us focaccia bread.
The mushroom dish was a great appetizer with right amount of saltiness and earthiness. This restored my thought that it's going to be a great meal.
However, when the two pasta dish came out it was a tale of two pasta. The gemelli sauce was great but the pasta itself a bit overcooked and fell apart. The cavadetti texture was perfect but sauce could have used a bit more salt. Some small changes would have made them perfect like I'm used at at Il Corvo. Also, the portions were on a smaller side even for fine dining.
Overall, they just opened not so long ago so hopefully they work out the small missteps by the time we dine there again."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alexis M.","Set my alarm for midnight exactly 30 days before the night I wanted to eat here to get the reservation on open table. Getting a reservation is a hassle, but it's definitely worth the wait. The service was amazing... one of the best I've experienced at any other restaurant in Seattle. The tables were all spaced out far apart, so each party had plenty of privacy. I saw people were raving about the focaccia, and it was good, but many other dishes were much more impressive. The ciccioli pork rillette antipasti dish was amazing!!! Our waiter described it to us as like an Italian Pâté. It was so tasty!!! The pasta dishes were all amazing as well. I had the sage pappardelle rabbit sugo. The pasta was cooked perfectly and you could really taste the sage!! My dad got the pasta special-- the scallops ravioli-- and he thought it was delicious, but I think he was even more impressed by the pork cheeks which came on some cheesy polenta. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!!"
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cassie W.","My absolute FAVORITE restaurant in Seattle. Their ravioli is to die for. The atmosphere is perfect and beautiful.
I love it. They do an amazing job."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brooke L.","I am writing this review after many many transgressions with this neighborhood establishment. If you ask.. why did you continue to go to this restaurant if you have had numerous bad/awful experiences, there are only two reasons: one, some of the service staff were amazing; two, proximity to my house. To be honest, the food has always been mediocre at best and the restaurant is so poorly run that it's a 50/50 chance that you will have cold food, bad food, or an awkward run in with the owner and his ""managers"".
Over the last ten years, I have had my wedding rehearsal dinner there, hosted large birthday parties, assisted in a large wedding reception, and recommended friend to do the same. With the exception of my rehearsal dinner, every event has been tainted by large mistakes, hidden charges, and general dishonesty. Last Friday, I hosted my husband's 40th Birthday, mainly because of the easy access for my guests, and also I thought by ordering family style and an open bar would be hard to mess up. I was wrong. They insulted my guests on many occasions and gave us 1 member of their staff for a group of 30 people. This staff member worked so incredibly hard at serving, bussing, and bartending it was impressive. However, it made the experience feel stressful and rushed. I made the best of it because I didn't want to ruin such a monumental party with our closest friends, but I left with a bit in my stomach about how everything had gone down. Most of all the treatment of my guests. It was embarrassing to say the least.
I will NEVER return to this restaurant for dinner, and I recommend at the very least, you should avoid having any of your treasured life time events at such a mismanaged place.
10 years of keep their lights on at times, is over."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alec F.","I've been Picolinos a few times before and have always been pleased with the food, atmosphere and wait service. Although my go-to dish of choice is usually the gnocchi, on this occasion I tried house made ravioli special and was glad I did; I can't remember the last time I had such delicious raviolis.
Not only was the food great, but the whole restaurant was transformed into a Christmas wonderland - I felt as though I was having dinner on the stage of the Nutcracker by Sendak.
The wine pairing suggested by the waiter went well with the ravioli... and my friend and I enjoyed the after dinner cappuccino, tiramisu and cannolis.
The only issue I had was that it seemed like the dining space was a little more cramped than normal - as every time the wait staff passed behind me, my chair would wind up getting bumped."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amandeep S.","I've been meaning to write a review for a while because Picolinos truly deserves the credit.
This is by far the BEST Italian food outside of Italy that I have had. My husband and I have been coming here for about 5 years now - mostly for special occasions - and it's still one of our favorite restaurants.
We recently came to celebrate my husband's birthday here and had yet again, a wonderful time! I made reservations a few days before and we were seated on their patio, which is filled with lots of plants, beautiful flowers and some decorative statues. You don't for a second feel like you're in Seattle!
Our server greeted us right away - he was SO friendly and took good care of us the whole evening. We got their bread and fresh pesto, which they make in house. They have a different specials menu each day so we started off with a salad off that menu, which consisted of butter lettuce, nectarines, berries and pistachios - it was absolutely delicious! And perfect for sharing :)
For our main course, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara, which I had been craving for a really long time, and my husband had the Spaghetti con Polpette (essentially spaghetti with meatballs). I have to say that I wish the carbonara was a little more creamy, because it turned out a little dry for my liking. But my husband enjoyed it and his dish as well.
And since it was my husband's birthday, our server brought out a free tiramisu on the house, with a little candle, so it was a really cute way for the restaurant to help us celebrate :)
I can't rave enough about this place, and am already looking forward to coming back!"
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","Time for an updated review! It has been nearly two years to the day from my last visit to Ristorante Piccolino's.
This is a long time Seattle favorite in the Ballard/Sunset Hill neighborhood. Established, polished, refined, but without the stuffiness. Often a reliable spot for celebratory get togethers, socializing at the bar, family meals, and date night. It also has an adjacent bakery and cafe and expansive terrace area.
Three months ago, tried to dine with the MKE Yelper in search of tiramisu. But the entire restaurant was closed for a film shoot with Hollywood stars TS and MS. Can't divulge this as it is a work in progress.
Returned this evening (9/15/19) with The Homie and was lucky to find nearby street parking and snag a two top without prior reservations made. With two newish establishments across the street, Samara and Baker's, parking can be a bit of a challenge.
From the host, our waitperson, and support dining staff, highly attentive service is provided. Menus, ice water, wine list, and bread service are provided upon being seated. Towards the end of the meal, another waitperson came over to say hello. She remembered us from visits 2 and 3 years ago!
We started with the Antipasto Misto Classico ($16), a generous array of marinated/grilled zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, olives, assorted cheeses and meats.
The Homie surprisingly went with a generous bowl of Rigatoni Salsiccia ($22.50) versus his usual Spaghetti Carbonara. Thick slices of Italian sausage simmered with a flavorful tomato sauce. Enough to box up that he will definitely have a delicious lunch tomorrow.
I ordered one of the featured dinner specials, Wild Forest Mushroom Ravioli ($23). Handmade ravioli with a trio of mushrooms in a cream sauce. I greatly appreciated that it was not heavy or salty. I savored this at Piccolino's, but admit to finishing the remainder while writing this updated post, patting my chubby tummy.
Wrapped up dinner with an espresso ($3) and Cheesecake ($8) for dessert. Again, The Homie didn't go with his usual gelato, made from a very old family recipe.
Me - definitely the tiramisu, no surprise ($8). Wish the layers were soaked just a tad more in espresso or coffee liqueur though. Delicious nevertheless and savored slowly.
Yes, a definite culinary splurge in a lovely dining setting. Makes one's visit a bit more special. But added bonus for consistent and well polished service plus palate pleasing cuisine, this is worth every dollar!
Definitely recommended!"
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia A.","My husband was really craving Italian one night and wanted to take me to this place - my favorite cuisine is Italian so I was excited right away, and rightfully so!
We arrived a couple minutes late from our reservation time, so it took about an extra 10 minutes for us to be seated at our table. Boy, were they BUSY the evening we came here for dinner! We didn't actually have the server come to our table to take our drinks/appetizers order until at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Most of the time, we would be very impatient at this point, but we did see how busy they were that evening and saw plenty of servers running around frantically, so we were okay with waiting. We ordered the Bruschetta di Pomodoro for an appetizer - absolutely delicious! We also ordered an appetizer off the specials menu (for the life of me I cannot remember the dish name) but sadly they were sold out of it. :(
For entrees, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Spaghetti Con Polpette. The Carbonara was absolutely delicious. But I will say there are few restaurants that make Carbonara truly the way it should be made (sadly Picolinos does not make it in the proper way) but it is still very delicious. My husband also LOVED the Spaghetti - he loves lamb and I'm not a big fan of lamb. His comment to the lamb meatballs was ""it is very lamb-y"", haha!
We truly enjoyed our dinner experience here, despite the longer than usual (I'm sure) wait times. I'm excited to come back here again!"
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thomas R.","Picolino's back garden bar is the perfect weekend hideout when you're needing an escape from the noise and congestion that has become Seattle.
You may have already heard that Picolinos offers great pasta, especially their spaghetti carbonara, which is so good that if you stick some on your forehead, your tongue'll slap your brains out trying to get to it. Honest! I've eaten here many times (just never in the garden) and it has always been good.
Now, let's get back to that bar in the back.
The garden bar is only open on weekends during warmer weather, which is prime time to sit and sip and forget everything. Nobody's going to rush you back here. Have a couple of Negronis or some beer before moving on to wine with dinner like we did. Gloria Gaynor and the Village People are playing in the background. I love this place.
The super-friendly bartender on duty last Friday was a real kick. This funny guy never intruded, but made us feel right at home. Scruffy barman would make some clever remark while resting his forearm on his knee after propping up his foot on something behind the bar and we would all laugh.
I like a barkeep who acts like he owns the place (or maybe he does?) yet never gets pushy or tries to sell you on something. He never asked us anything stupid like, ""would you like a salad with that?"" or ""how is everything tasting?"" This guy is a pro. His only unsolicited questions were ""what'll it be guys?"" and later on, ""how're you doing?""
Although quiet and unobtrusive, he was always visible, so if we wanted something, we only needed to flag him down.
His bar service alone receives 5 perfect golden A+ stars.
Oh yeah, and the food is delicious, too. Did I mention the carbonara? You're going to want some of that.
I'm so lucky I can walk here and stumble home. You should get a lyft or a cab if you can't hoof it, but do come here and sit in the back bar. It'll be one of your favorite new spots. I know it's one of mine."

We wanted to get a seat outside, but they had closed the outside area due to the weather. That was the only bummer for us in the whole experience.
The food and service was excellent. They had an elaborate specials menu, and they also did a custom order of truffle oil pasta for my friend. The rigatoni, wild mushroom ravioli and gnocchi were super appetizing but the custom truffle oil pasta was amazingly delicious. We didn't order a wood fired pizza and desserts. But I'm definitely gonna try that in my next visit.

"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Josh P.","So this is a few months late as I recently decided Id love to give feedback on the places I've been to, both good and bad. Picolinos would fall under the GREAT category, If I lived down the road id be there 2-3 times a week if not more. However I have been there half a dozen times every time the experience is spectacular, ive recommended this place to so many.
Lets start with the atmosphere not your typical atmosphere very rustic and unique which I like, especially at night time. Great date night spot as it has a very romantic atmosphere, first time I was there I spent 3 hours on a date just enjoying this place.
The food ive had is incredible, would very much recommend the Margherita pizza as an appetizer and as for the entree I can only give a personal recommendation for the Pork Belly Ravioli as its the only thing ive ordered just with how good it is, I get it every time. Although others I have gone with have complimented how amazing their dish was so I can only assume their entire menu is just as delicious as the one I order is.
As for the drinks ive had, they make one of the best old fashioned around and I know my old fashioned. I have had a few of their wines as they do have a very extensive wine list.
With all that being said, I would highly recommend experiencing Picolinos for yourself, you will not be disappointed and this wasn't just a one time experience and review for me, ive been a number of times and im still blown away by this place, if you love Italian food, you need to check this place out."

A word to the wise if you go in through the door to the most right, you have entered the breakfast and lunch counter and you don't spot that, they may tell you they are closed not realizing you came for dinner next door.
Once we got past that, we were treated by a friendly staff with more than the minimum of on duty folks.
Each of got a bread basket which is nice as some places charge extra for a few slices of sub par bread, not here.
Caesar salad was ample and nicely dressed.
If toy want traditional carbonara, they leave out the eggs, but still call it by the traditional name. It's good, but it isn't carbonara.
The other dish was a puttanesca which could have done with more traditional olives and capers but was still quite good.
Both dishes were ample and a good value for the price which made for left overs the next day.
Get there early as even on a week night it was busy."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bryce B.","Reminiscent of the kind of Italian restaurants you'd find in homey NYC neighborhoods. Although quite roomy, it still manages to feel very cozy inside, with decor reminiscent of your grandmother's house. Service is friendly and personal, they really make you feel at home.
Sure, there are meat dishes on the menu, but this is a place that clearly takes its pasta seriously. You want to come here on a carb cheat day. Picolinos is, and deservedly so, known for their housemade raviolis. But realistically, you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and Spaghetti Con Frutti di Mare are both outstanding. Even the pizza is pretty good, but it's best as an appetizer for a table of four. Not sure I'd make a meal out of just that.
Dessert? Tiramisu is top notch. I wouldn't bother with anything else when this is so good.
They even have live music on occasion. Wine list is dominated by Italian varietals and PNW selections."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ben W.","Simply not restaurant quality. Pizza was flop city - cheese and toppings slid right off. Carbonara was under sauced and noodles were over cooked.
Unfortunate to pay $50 for this meal, and honestly dissapointed in the yelp community. There is no chance this place is 4 stars. Y'all need to tighten it up.
Only positive is the outdoor seating area.
Will not be returning."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tracy J.","Wow. How do I describe Picolinos ... I have spent so much time at this restaurant with my family for quiet celebrations or to have a cup of coffee in their European style coffee nook.
Piccolino's is an extremely large brick building in a quiet Ballard neighborhood. When you walk in it is quite dark. The tables are set with heavy silver. The tables are dark wood, And restaurant is split up into 2 or 3 different dining areas which gives it a cozy, intimate feeling. There's also a full service bar.
But my favorite place to go is the outdoor patio in back of the building. It's a huge outdoor patio. It's also landscaped as a garden. There are potted plants everywhere and draping vines and flowers. I've never seen another outdoor dining space in Seattle that is so beautiful. It's like having dinner in someones garden. There's also a tented outdoor seating section with a Moroccan feel. Dark drapes and very spacious. If you can't decide if you want to dine inside or outside, that area would be a great compromise. At any rate, wherever you sit it will be an experience. As for the food, I would take the rating down to 4 stars. I haven't had anything on the menu that I really loved. The foods okay. I think their menu could be reworked to provide more vegetarian options. But we don't go there for the food. We go there for the atsmosphere."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ben C.","Absolutely wonderful experience and some of my favorite food that I've had in Seattle. My girlfriend and I went to the restaurant last night to catch an early dinner before going to a musical. Though we had a reservation, we were given the option to sit either inside or outside, of which we chose the latter.
The outdoor garden is absolutely beautiful. It made me feel far removed from the hustle and bustle of actual Seattle living.
We each ordered a wine which was very fairly priced. Bottle and premium wine options seemed like a reasonable markup when compared to the normal 3-4x you see. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly ravioli and I ordered the special lamb ravioli, both of which were absolutely amazing. The pork belly ravioli was very rich with a non-overpowering amount of white truffle oil included.
Very happy to have eaten here and I look forward to my next experience."

We ordered takeout since we wanted to eat at the comfort of our own place that was just beside the restaurant as I read that service could be better. I looooooove carbonara pasta and was stoked to see it on the menu w their homemade spaghetti. It had just the right touch of cream, bacon, and cheese. Mmm! Although I was eyeing the pesto penne, we went with the spaghetti de mare because my mom wanted something w seafood. That was light and scrumptious as well. If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet. It was the icing on top of an already totally above our expectations meal. If you're in the area, stop by for some homemade pasta. Your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!"

Ambiance:
It has a nice dim-lit casual atmosphere. Lunch and dinner is good here.
Service:
Service is alright. They don't do anything out of their way, or even try to be friendly. You're just a paying customer to them, that's about it.
Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.
All in all, if you're willing to forgive their dismal excuse of a bread and look past that, everything else is great!"
"La Vita E Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-vita-e-bella-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Sharon C.","Came here to celebrate my friends' birthdays! There's plenty of street parking. Pretty good prices for pasta here. It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again."

The carbonara we received was clearly mad with whole eggs--there were chunks of gross undercooked egg whites throughout. We immediately contacted GrubHub who contacted the restaurant.

"La Vita E Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-vita-e-bella-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Kayla K.","I'll start off by saying that the food was good.
However, everything else was not good. I asked the server his preference between two pasta dishes. He suggested one over the other, so I ordered that. Our salad came out quickly, and then the entrees took forever. We were all very hungry by the time our entrees arrived, about 30+ minutes later. The entree given to me was not what I had ordered. It wasn't even the other pasta dish I had asked about. I told the waiter this and he begrudgingly took the entree away. It was not what I had ordered, why is that my fault? I thought that they would hurry to make the correct entree, but I was wrong. My family finished their meals and then my food was given to me. At this point, I had waited an hour total for my entree. I asked the server for pepper flakes, he never came back with them. I had to ask two more times before they were brought to me.
Then, the receipt came. We were charged for the incorrect entree that they had initially brought out to me. The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to fix the receipt. They not only tried to charge us more than we should have paid, but did not apologize once, or comp anything for the inconvenience. Not even my $3 soft drink.
A sorry would have gone a long way in this situation, but it never came. The whole time I felt like I was the one at fault. We will not be returning to La Vita E Bella."

Really?
The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,

The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.

"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan M.","Exactly the experience I expected from a nice evening out at a nice-looking place such as this.
We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we want and we got a nice little table in the corner by the fire outside. The menu was fairly small, especially for food, which I actually love! The options were quite wonderful and I could've ordered nearly anything on the menu.
We opted to start with ""The Dark Heart"" for the cocktail and a glass of wine. Both were excellent. Our appetizer was three little fried risotto and cheese balls that were delicious!
For a main course we got the pasta with Wild Boar Ragu and goat cheese along with the Pesto Risotto topped with New York Steak. $14 and $18 respectively. Great value at such a place like this.
For dessert I got a tiramisu which was exactly what you would expect from a high-end tiramisu so it was nothing impressive or unique but it was very good. I could say the same for the crème brûlée. It was your standard crème brûlée but it had a really really nice taste. Everything here was done very well and the evening was wonderful. The two servers that continually took care of us were wonderful as well.
Not only was it a wonderful experience but it was a pretty good value I think. The bill was less than $100. I'll be back!!"

We went there before heading to an event and while the food portions are small the price is reasonable enough you can order a few things. I had the Arancini, which they often run out of. They were fantastic. Though I love a good riceball.
Moving on to the next course I had the Fettucine carbonara. Delicious. Small, but great. Same with the cherry duck confit with polenta. Fruity, delicious, wonderfully cooked.
The tiramisu was also great, though other people I was dining with thought it was too strong.
Service is great, though we were there on a slow night. Still, I get the feeling service is always good.
A hidden gem not too far from the stadiums. I will definitely be back."

I didn't go with a cocktail this time because I just wanted a glass of bubbles. But my late night dinner special of spaghetti and meatballs stuffed with mozzarella was delicious. At first glance I thought it was a little light on the portion size. But after eating I was sufficiently satisfied.
We also started with the sausage stuffed olives and they were very good! My only not would be I wished there was a sauce on the side. The olive and sausage combined was so rich that a it needed a tomato sauce or something similar to cut that richness. We still finished them and they were still darn tasty."

So this was our lucky day! We sat up at the bar and our bartender was wonderful the whole night.
We started with the anti pasta. It was delish. Full of yummy veggies, some meat, cheese and bread. For entrees we ordered shrimp risotto and carbonara. Both entrees were excellent! The shrimp were wrapped beautifully in prosciutto. The carbonara was just as lovely and my fav out of the two dishes but not by much b/c they were both so good!
The ambience in here is beautiful and sexy. It's a great place for a date night or for a more intimate night out with friends.

However, I do the taste of this dish, so I would still recommend this. The chop salad with steak is also a good choice, steak is medium rare and cooked perfectly. Everything taste perfectly together, especially with avocado! Highly recommend the salad. I will definitely go back and try other things.

Upon entering, I was in awe of its decor and atmosphere. My friends and I didn't order any drinks, but it seems like their drink selection is pretty vast and reasonably priced. We each ordered a pasta, which was on the smaller side in terms of portions. The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the noodle to sauce ratio was pretty good.

- Steak tartare (3/5): This was tasty, but the steak was at times difficult to chew.
- Prawn risotto (5/5): Incredible. The prawns were amazing! They were grilled and wrapped in prosciutto -- very tender and perfectly seasoned. The risotto was very well done as well.

"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Sebastian T.","Upon wanting to explore all the cocktail bars in the Seattle area, Intermezzo Carmine not only offered cocktails but also Italian food. I went with a friend and decided to give it a shot! The space was a bit small, but it had a relaxed upscale vibe. This would be a great spot for ordering just cocktails without food as well. I'd love to come back in the summer as they have a nice outdoor seating area too.
The drinks and the food were at a typical upscale price & portion. I tried a cocktail, the glazed duck confit & the spaghetti Nero.
The cocktails were great, and exactly as i would expect at this price point. No qualms here!
The glazed duck confit as average at best, the cherry glaze didnt seem to compliment the flavor of the duck very well, and parts of the duck was overcooked and dry.
The spaghetti Nero was fantastic, it was an interesting touch to add the smoked salmon, as it was my first time having smoked salmon with the pasta but it strangely complimented the flavors well, the smokiness blended with the tomato & the creaminess seemed to blend right in with the flavors of the pasta.
Overall, it is a bit pricey for what you get, but given that this is finer dining, it was a satisfying experience. I wasn't wow'ed enough to come back again, but i would recommend coming by at least once to check out the space!"

The way we were now seated, I had one friend just sitting by himself cut off from the rest of us.
Our server was rude and just not mentally present. Our drinks took forever to come, I had to reorder my wine twice since the server was spaced out. They even picked up my pasta before I finished it- by far the worst service I have ever received. All of us agreed that we would never return to this place."

There was plenty of space to have a private meal and tons of natural light. The cocktails were very unique and super tastey. Not too sweet which I always worry about. The bartender was awesome and gave us plenty of recommendations for Seattle and Portland.

One of my favorites is the fettucine carbonara. I've had the lamb chops and the bone marrow which were really good too. These are all really rich, so make sure to order a drink with it!
The dishes are all pretty small so whenever I come here, we order a couple of dishes so we can try a little of each."
"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Mikall D.","Wow - the atmosphere and service was impeccable. Professional, attentive, and kind staff. Certain food items were delicious , others were just okay..which is the reason for a deduction of 1 star. I will likely go back and try some different items ."
"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda C.","Was quite disappointed with this place. FYI I came for food and not drinks, so can't comment on their cocktails. I thought the squid ink pasta was very average, the pasta was cooked longer than al dente, and the portions were small. Flavors were there though. The arancini that my friends and I shared was also just okay. The risotto inside was really bland, and I could not really taste the mushrooms."
"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Rian F.","Great food, smaller selection than their parent restaurant. Had dessert and drinks. The creme brûlée was awesome! My wife liked the tiramisu as well. Only thing is that the place is a little loud."
"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Irina B.","A really underwhelming experience here given the excellent reviews. The food was bland and nothing special, and the service didn't help either. The arincini was really disappointing - it didn't have a crispy crust and tasted like plain rice, no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I also had the grilled veggie salad which tasted fine but it wasn't anything special. My friend had the bucatini, which apparently was good but not great. Portion sizes are on the small side but I think the prices reflect that. Prices are pretty low for the location and ambience (the decor was nice) but you can get way better tasting food for the same price elsewhere.
Our server was dismissive and cold from the moment we walked in to when we left, which didn't help the mediocre food. Would not come back."
"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Bo P.","Keep in mind this isn't a general rating, but a subjective one based on my experience and dish alone :)
I've been to Intermezzo a handful of times for happy hour, but this was a different experience. Our waiter was incredible. Friendly, attentive, but gave us our time/space to catch up with the friends that we were with. We were waiting for the birthday girl to show up, and he was genuinely patient as he continued to bring out plates of bread to keep us preoccupied.
The fettucini carbonara was honestly perfection to me. The noodles were al dente, there was just the right amount of pancetta, and the poached egg's consistency was just as I wanted.
The waiter (I wish I got his name!) comped a tiramisu on behalf of the birthday girl, and while we told him it was OK, he insisted, and we obliged. And we were so happy that we did. They say it's a delicious 100-year old recipe and it tastes exactly like that. Best tiramisu I've had to date."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Samuel B.","Came in for brunch on a rainy Saturday day and though I had been here before for lunch, I had never been for brunch. I was very pleasantly surprised.
I ordered the grilled rustic bread with the poached eggs and a coffee with Frangelico. The hollandaise was a bit lukewarm but the staff was immediately on it and did not just warm it up...the dish was remade! That's good service to me.
The decor is lovely, the waitstaff is attentive, and the food was delicious. Certainly worth the trip!"
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sean T.","This place was expensive, which would be finif I got a decent ROI for my money... I didn't.
The food tasted like diner food.
The service was decent.
Place was empty which should have been our clue."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Danielle W.","I can not recommend this spot to anyone. We tried to appetizers, the burrata and the asparagus and both were not good. The asparagus was very crunchy and tasteless, we left most on the plate.
We tried the squid ink pasta and another red sauce based one.
The pastas were bland, and unfulfilling. We boxed our food to go, and I went to subway right afterward, and honestly it was better.
If you want good Italian, I suggest Alturo in Capitol Hill."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa J.","I wanted to like this place since the food wasn't exactly bad and the place had a nice ambiance to it. But it was overpriced, service was lacking, portions too small, and they add a service charge to your bill (before tax)!
We had the sweet potato gnocchi as an appetizer to share. It was good but very small portion. For the main meal I had the clam linguine which was good but again, portion was small, the clams were teeny tiny, and barely any linguine underneath. I was left feeling HUNGRY (hangry).
My boyfriend ordered the ribeye with ""porcini potatoes"". He loves porcini mushrooms but was disappointed that there wasn't even a trace of porcini on the plate. The ribeye was good though.
We wanted to ask our waiter about the ""porcini potatoes"" but he never bothered to ask how our meal was. He walked by our table many times and never stopped to check on us at all! He only talked to us when he brought us the check- which included a service charge before taxes. For adding a service charge, this place did not deliver to a higher standard of service. Our waiter barely even did his job except bring us 3 plates of food.
Don't come here if you are hungry. This place is way too overpriced for mediocre Italian food"
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yolanda S.","We've been passing by Tulio everyday on our way to work and finally had the pleasure to visit this establishment due to the proximity of the hotel we stayed in. We were only looking to have a nightcap so we sat at the bar and had the Finocchio Negroni cocktail. What a special concoction this was made with Fords gin, fennel campari, cynar, china china and orange bitters. It was so delicious I had two of them served by the most hospitable bartender named Leah. Another person in our party ordered the chicken. It was roasted with caramelized garlic and sage and served on lemon risotto. That is definitely on our list for the next time we visit and we are also looking forward to having brunch. Maybe we'll have the hand made biscuits and /or the handmade cinnamon roll. Can't wait!"
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Hyozzang C.","Came for brunch after friends recommendation. Thoroughly disappointed. Pasta was mediocre, brunch menu was subpar, service felt rushed. I substituted sausage for veggies in my pasta dish and what veggies?! Lol it was very laughable. Please tell me if you see any veggies in the red sauce pasta dish. There were tiny onions and 3 mushrooms. No offer of pepper or grated cheese. Isn't that standard?
In conclusion, everything was mediocre. Would not recommend and will not come back. You know that feeling when you go to a restaurant and you go through immediate feelings of regret because you dont want to eat the food, but it feels like a waste of money?"
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dana R.","Tulio used to be one of my Seattle favorites for the smoked salmon ravioli with a super light lemon cream sauce and asparagus tips ... that dish went away and came back and is now gone again. While dining here most recently (about a year ago) Chef Pisano was in the dining room, I asked him whether there was a chance of the dish coming back ... I was surprised at the curt response ... no, our customers want healthier dishes ... really? Several items on the menu have butter, cheese, cream or crema sauces ... it's okay to good-naturedly say we want to change things up. Gotta be honest, it was a bit of a bummer interaction.
The sweet potato gnocchi used to be pillow soft but has been overworked and a bit tougher/gummier the last 2 times I've ordered it (the executive chef at Marco Canora's Hearth in NYC taught me how to make gnocchi and it's easy to overwork the potato dough).
The roasted chicken with caramelized garlic, sage and lemon risotto is fabulous. Rich, rich, rich."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rachel R.","I ordered a cup of coffee and enjoyed the tremendous service, relaxing environment, and good company."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","Tulio reminds me a lot of old Italian restaurants on the East Coast - great use of wood, moulding, and quality materials while being a bit more 'buttoned up' than most restaurants in Seattle (even the 'fancier' ones).
We went for lunch on a Friday and while they were full, they were able to seat us in the bar. Service was prompt and friendly. We were almost immediately served four slices of soft bread with olive oil for dipping.
We ordered two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and I ordered the agnolotti and my co-worker ordered risotto. The food came out remarkably fast, and the agnolotti - OMG! YUM! At first, the use of lemon was a little overpowering in this creamy dish, but when paired with the cheese inside of the pasta, it was balanced very nicely. My co-worker enjoyed his risotto and we happily drank the sauv blanc (which was good, but a bit pricey per glass).
The environment here would make for a great place to bring someone when feeling a bit more upscale, or if you're on a date. The food was delicious, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying the full dinner menu."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jay A.","So disappointed. I was here several years ago and had a creamy pasta dish with pork belly. It was luxuriant! I raved about it So I was eager to ordered it when I got into town, recently. Oof.
Really really unenjoyable. I kept putting salt on it to try and bring out some flavor but there was really nothing to work with. Very little sauce, dry pork belly. The worst part was that I talked someone else into ordering the same.Too many other wonderful options in the area to make me want to go back. Lesson learned."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathryn S.","Perhaps it is true that familiarity breeds contempt because, after our first breakfast at Tulio, I would have given Tulio a 4. But we ate four breakfasts here as well as three dinners. It's now down to a 3; meaning, average.
Let me start by stating that not one waitress (breakfast) or waiter (dinner), or the Bartender, introduced themselves. We asked one waiter (Shawn) his name; and we asked the Bartender (Leah) her name. No one told us their names.
I do like the Matre D. On one occasion, he told us which three tables he had available and let us chose. Another evening, he set a professional basketball player and her friend next to us. That was kind of cool.
The restaurant is pleasantly dark, lots of wood, very traditional and warm. Love the interior. However, getting in and out of the booths (which we did twice at breakfast) is hard; especially getting out of them. We then started asking for a table for breakfast. We had stuff to spread out, literature for planning our day. Even though four-tops were available, we were always seated at two-tops which didn't give us room to plan our day.
First breakfast: Hubby had the Waffle with fresh fruit, syrup, a compote and whipped cream. He doesn't like compote or whipped cream; he wants syrup on his Waffle. It's Italian syrup, so way too sweet for his taste. Several days later, I ordered the Waffle and used the compote which I loved as well as a wee bit of whipped cream, which was delicious. In my case, I also ordered bacon, ""crispy, please."" The bacon was prepared ""crispy,"" as I had asked.
First breakfast: I had the Frittata which was topped with dollops of Goat Cheese. It was good. The OJ is $5. I guess that is typical of restaurants but the first breakfast was the first and last time we ordered juice. After that, we swallowed our pills with water. I never have more than a few swallows of coffee, so I brought my own coffee in from the Hotel Lobby. Why pay $5 for half a cup of coffee?
Speaking of water: It is served without asking in all of the Seattle restaurants we visited; and, of course, served without straws. I have a problem with that, because I don't believe that all restaurants get their glasses germ-free; I don't believe the water gets hot enough to sanitize. Just saying.
Second breakfast: My husband wasn't very hungry, so he ordered the Cinnamon Roll. It wasn't warm and the icing had congealed. I had the Waffle and bacon and was very happy.
Third breakfast: We knew we would be out in the wet and rain all day, so we both had Oatmeal. I was surprised it wasn't served with milk. The next day, I ordered Oatmeal again. Different waitress; this one offered milk. We split a Fruit Plate.
Fourth breakfast: By now we were so tired of their limited breakfast menu, we could scream. Fortunately, I rode the elevator with a hotel guest who was carrying two cups of coffee in a tray and a bag of pastries. The next morning, we walked just one block to Vovito where we had tasty, warm Turkey & Cheese Croissant Sandwiches and good coffee. We spent $20 on breakfast at Vovito's instead of $40 at Tulio.
Tulio adds a 5% surcharge to their bills. Hubby didn't notice it when he paid for our first breakfast. I noticed it later. After that, I took care of the bills. I tipped 15% consistently, instead of 20%. In Seattle, check your restaurant bills to see if you're being charged any or all of the gratuity. We dined at two restaurants that add 20% BUT they are clear about it, and say that the wait staff do not expect more. Tulio is sneakier. They make it sound as if it's in accordance with a law to provide a higher minimum wage, but that actually isn't the case at all.
First dinner: We shared the Gnocchi appetizer. The Gnocchis are stuft with Sweet Potatoes and then lightly pan-fried. They were surprisingly good. I had Linguini with Clams. Couldn't see any linguini because there were so many clams. I did eventually get down to the Linguini, at which time I requested cheese. They don't shave the cheese at your table; they spoon already shredded cheese onto your food upon request.
Second dinner: Bartender Leah is great at her job. One evening we just sat at the bar. We wanted some food to soak up the liquor but found their Appetizer Menu to be sorely lacking. When I told Leah there was nothing on it that suited, she offered to put together an antipasto plate. We accepted. We had drinks, the antipasto plate and one slice of Tiramisu. Our bill came to $145!!! Yikes!
Third dinner: My husband had Mussells and thoroughly enjoyed them; the best Mussels he's ever had. I had Pumpkin Soup. It was okay. I've had better. (Five Spice Pumpkin Soup at the historic Panamonte Inn in Boquete, Panamá.)
Dinners are served with Foccacia, but the bread is bland bland bland. We eat Foccacia at home frequently, but what we buy from Trader Joe's is tasty. This was so bland that it was ""one and done."""
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jen Z.","I came here for a business dinner. Tulio it is at a great location as it is right next to the Seattle Public library, the W Seattle, and the Fairmont.
The herb bread was awesome. For drinks, I ordered the lavender Lemon Tini. It was delicious. For food, I ordered the prosciutto wrapped asparagus as an appetizer and orecchiette for entree. The white asparagus and duck egg was an adventure. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The pasta was simple yet comforting. I especially loved the spicy Italian sausage.
Nothing too crazy. Just a good time. Probably not worth a special trip into town. But if you are close by, why not."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Makiah H.","DELICIOUS!!! Another hidden gem within the Kimpton hotel. Except service, amazing food and a great ambiance. Came here for dinner and can't wait to come back! Sat upstairs, they have a great large table for bigger groups and also allows for a little more privacy. Call ahead for reservations as it can get pretty busy. If you're in the mood for great quality Italian food or some great wines this is a must."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tyger M.","Tulio is my new favorite evening spot, conveniently located 1 block from work and inside the hotel where I typically stay when in Seattle. I'm normally on the verge of being vegetarian, so i love the gnocchi and the risotto, but adore the agnolotti.
Service here is splendid. Sit at the bar if you're here solo. A great experience with company or on your own."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Claudia C.","An amazing little corner place that I really recommend stopping in. I loved how knowledgeable the staff were so when I asked about how things were made and if I could get something without dairy they already knew how things were made and what I could eat.
I got the chicken on a lemon risotto and it was so amazing. It was a perfect balance of lemon with the chicken and who knew risotto could be made without dairy.
The bf got a leg of lamb or something and that was so tender if was falling off the bone."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa P.","We stayed at Kimpton for a few nights before deciding to eat at Tulio. We realized the hotel had given us a $25 discount on a meal there and we were just too tired to go out anywhere else. What a pleasant surprise! The place was cozy and felt very intimate. The service was outstanding and so friendly. The unexpected star for our trip and standout meal. I started with the sweet potato gnocchi, amazing. For dinner I had the roasted chicken with lemon risotto, very good but a tad salty. Still the chicken was cooked perfect. My husband had the ribeye, which he really enjoyed. He also had the local flight of whiskey. He enjoyed that as well.
If I could have, I would give 4.5 stars. Pretty close to perfection had my dinner not been on the salty side....and I even like and usually add salt to my dishes, so if I think it's salty, it's pretty salty."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Josef K.","I could not be more disappointed with Tulio. It's been years since I was last in here, but lunch today was so poor I may not return. The restaurant was probably 40% full and despite that we waited an unreal amount of time for some prosciutto wrapped asparagus (that takes maybe 8 minutes to make) and salads of cold chicken and avocado. Had the chicken been warm I could have imagined a little more time may have been needed. I could have made that entire meal in 12-15 minutes MAX by myself. We waited probably 30-40 minutes. And it wasn't even that good. Inexcusable. You're better than this Tulio."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tammy Y.","We had a pre-show dinner here in the bistro section (front part of the restaurant by the windows) and were not disappointed! I had bookmarked this place ages ago and finally made it in. They have a large menu of beverages to start off the meal, including a long list of various grappas.
I enjoyed the mixed greens with gorgonzola and the mussels before sharing the butternut squash soup (delicioso!) and linguini and clams. The linguini was a little too al dente for my taste as I couldn't get the noodles to stay wrapped around my fork but the sauce was flavorful and delicious. I will have to return for the pumpkin gelato in the future as I was out of room and needing to head to the theatre at the end of the meal. Looking forward to it! Service was wonderful!"
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Will H.","Decided to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary here with friends yesterday due to good reviews and proximity to our hotel (the Fairmont Olympic around the corner). Based on our experience I wouldn't recommend Tulio for anyone celebrating a special occasion. Our server ignored the table for most of the evening and was extremely inattentive. The bill included a $39 charge for several glasses of the ""complimentary"" prosecco that was brought to the table when we arrived. After pointing this out it was removed from the bill but it just one of several oversights by the server, including a fly in my spouse's coffee to end the evening. The food was fine but I felt like they could have cared less about our table or the occasion. I would strongly discourage anyone from spending your special occasion here."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Shreya K.","Came here for my parents anniversary dinner and were not super impressed. I picked this place for the great reviews but sadly the food was just average. I honestly would've given 3 stars as the ambience was nice but the waiter tacked on a $62 bottle of wine that we didn't even order. While this could've been an honest mistake it really felt intentional from his behavior and lack of surprise or apology when I pointed it out. Really sketchy/rude if you ask me. The chicken and risotto were both good, but the veggie pizza had no flavor at all. If you're looking for a good Italian restaurant there are tons of better options--The Pink Door being my favorite."

Also love that they provide complimentary sparkling spring water and fresh focccacia bread (sooo freaking good, and did i mention it's complimentary???).
Most recently, booked this place for a team lunch and everyone really enjoyed their meals (including the vegetarians!). They have something on the menu to satisfy any type of craving/dietary restrictions -- from housemade pastas/pizzas to a variety of seafoods and steaks.
I ordered their seafood salad which was loaded with fresh prawns, octopus, squid, and clams. Very generous portions and fresh flavors!
Yes, the prices here are a bit steeper than your typical lunch fare in SLU, but totally worth IMO. Also great for larger group gatherings as they have a table in the back that fits 10+ people."
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jared M.","Great spot in SLU for some Italian food.

Positives - polite and efficient waitstaff, attentive service. Very good wine list, the wine expert in our group managed to pick two really good wines at a reasonable price point ($40). A couple of the dishes were really good - the cuttlefish and the octopus items
Rest of the dishes were mediocre given the price point of the restaurant. These were more fitting of a mass market Italian restaurant."

We ordered the octopus/buratta/Chilean sea bass/seafood stew. My goodness! Seafood stew was some of the best I've ever had served with a split lobster tail. Every bite was delicious.

We were immediately seated since we had a reservation and got served bread on the table right away. The waitress was respectful about us needing to be in a rush due to lunch break. I ordered the Funghi Di Stagione pizza which was served in a timely manner. The mushrooms on the pizza were sufficient; however I thought it needed to be seasoned more since it was lacking in flavour. Also the dough was a bit on the burnt side which overpowered all of the toppings on the pizza but the cheese was very fragrant. Overall I recommend this place for Italian food but could be better with these suggestions!"
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Maya D.","I will preface my review by saying I do not like salad! Today I had the perfect salad with fresh baby greens, radicchio, and buttery Gorgonzola cheese, accented by fresh olive oil and fresh lemon. Can I say that I am truly a fan of simple food combinations.
Tonight eggplant Parmesan was the special. The chef prepared a plate of thinly sliced eggplant layered with mozzarella and fresh basil. Heavenly is the best way to describe my meal.
Topped it off with tiramisu (lady fingers soaked in coffee and amaretto). Probably the best I have ever tasted. It was not too sweet and just the perfect portion.
It was my birthday so it was served with a sparkling firework.
This is a great place for date night."
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Xinran A.","Went there with my dad just to try their famous seafood soup and was not disappointed! They will split the soup for you if they know you are sharing, which is nice and convenient.
Each soup has a variety of seafood and the amount is decent for 20ish bucks/person. I really like the bread they put into the soup as not every restaurant does that and I particularly like the texture of bread after it was soaked in the soup and absorbed all the juice. They also gave you free baguette so you can dip the bread in the soup even more. However the soup does get cold pretty quickly and that can affect its taste and the dining experience.
We didn't order anything else and I was satisfied after eating. I think one appetizer + the soup will definitely make two people full, or just the soup itself might also be fine depending on your appetite.
The environment is modern and the service is on point. I would say this restaurant is good for either casual dining or for special days like anniversary/birthday etc."
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ronda N.","Italian done the right way! I ate here for lunch and was blown away by everything. The restaurant's decor is open, airy modern. It is bright and refreshing just like many restaurants in Italy.
The menu offers a wide range of meats, pastas, pizzas, etc.. The wine list is extensive with many that compliment the food.
My family and I shared a fettuccine alfredo appetizer to start. It was AMAZING!!! We then had minestrone soup, mix green salad before our spaghetti and veal meatballs. It was a guilt free meal made from the best ingredients.
The host and server were excellent. We had nice seating choices and our meals were timed perfectly."
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Duyen T.","Perhaps I'm just not the target clientele for this place and that's quite alright! Definitely get the vibe that this place is pretending to be fancier than it actually is. I had a lunch here and expected some reasonably priced lunch options, but nope still experienced sticker shock. I had the appetizer size of the pulpo (octopus) and the waitress was very nice in warning me that it really is a snack size of 5 bites, and I appreciated the warning! So I fully knew what I was in for but it was still a bit surprising to see the plate in front of me. It was a dressed up single mini tentacle for $14. My coworker let me try her pesto pasta and it was a wee bit too al dente, almost to the verge of undercooked.
Pros: Delicious complimentary bread and olive oil for dipping.
I'll try coming back for happy hour and see if that changes my mind."
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","5 star happy hour, 3-4 star regular hours.
Cinque Terre (and neighboring Barolo) are home to some of the best happy hours in Seattle. 50% off bar food and select bottles of wine (red, white or rose) for $20... (and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for $48 is a steal) you really can't beat that for quality Italian food and fresh seafood. The happy hour is such a great deal, but I find regular prices a little spendy for the portion size (although I suppose you could argue the quality makes up for it).
The complimentary bread is seasoned and soft, paired nicely with a chili olive oil of some type. I recommend ordering a multitude of things to split amongst your group; the polpo is one of my favorites (keep in mind the happy hour polp is a very small portion, whilst the polpo Mario entree is larger and over mashed potatoes... YUM!). Happy hour includes a half dozen oysters for $11. For dessert, there are some classic Italian desserts, none of them to be regretted. I'm a sucker for good tiramisu, and theirs is light, fluffy and hits the spot. The food presentation and service is always top notch.
The ambiance is fine, though the decor feels a little too 'trying really hard to be modern and upscale' to me (but this could impress your guests if that is appealing to them) - and there's a small outdoor space you can sit in when the weather is nice. Note that it sits next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so it can be pretty busy for happy hours right after work Monday - Friday. Luckily, they have a late night happy hour that begins at 9 p.m., so if you can hold out until then, it's well worth it!"

The waiter was very nice and ensured we enjoyed our food. He even got to know us better by having a small conversation. I would come back to try something else other then the pizza because was not impressed. The bread here is amazing and would come back for the bread they serve. We got seconds of the bread. They are known for their seafood but would have to ask a friend to try it and let me know since I am vegetarian."

I arrived around 5:30pm and got the liberty to choose a table near the window. Great view and nice vibe. It started with complimentary sparkling water and bread with olive oil, both of which were great. I had fettuccine con gamberi al limone, which contained five huge prawns and various spices. It tasted really creamy and had different layers of tastes. It came in large portion and I could barely finish it. For dessert I chose tiramisu, and thought it was their special. It came with a little firework, which was awesome and made me really happy about it. The tiramisu was nicely presented, with fresh berries dotted on each corner of the plate. It was not bad, it was just average. Overall I enjoyed my time here:)"
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kimmy L.","My friends and I were craving Italian, so we went here for Seattle Restaurant Week.
The atmosphere was very modern and pleasant. We also arrived earlier than our reservation, but we were seated right away.
While I was perusing the menu, the waiter gave us complimentary made-in-house focaccia bread. The bread was good, but the olive oil lacked taste.
Since the Seattle restaurant week deal was 3 courses for $35, I ordered:
Appetizer- Spring Salad with dried lemon, cheese and walnuts
Entree- Seafood Cioppinno (Seafood in a tomato broth)
Dessert- Tiramisu.
My friend ordered the same thing as me, and we were both very disappointed by the salad. Even though it came with a dressing, it was extremely bland. I also thought the dried lemon was a strange salad topping.
The seafood cioppinno was the best dish of the three, although it was overly salted. They were generous with the amount and variety of seafood though. It had octopus, fish, clams, mussels and shrimp.
The slices of tiramisu were HUGE. It had a good creamy texture, but it only had slight notes of espresso. It mainly just tasted like whipped cream which was disappointing.
Service and atmosphere were excellent, but I was not wowed by the food here and will not come back."

Both times- the service was perfectly matched to the atmosphere. The servers were timely and not over bearing, giving suggestions of wine or food when needed, and always ensuring we enjoyed what we were consuming.

I hadn't actually been to GH Pasta Co before, and I didn't know it was fast casual, but we were in a rush anyway, so I pushed that we try it out. My sister quickly shut up once the fork of pasta was in her mouth. The food spoke for itself. Didn't need to be anything fancy, sit down, or Michelin-rated...the pasta was so dang good it was in a category of its own; let's call this category ""Ain't 't Gotta Be Fancy To Win Mouths.""
Seriously, get anything off the menu, it's all delicious. Even the salads are awesome, if you're not a salad person.
Highly recommend. Not sure if Grassa is owned by SA aw company, but both are similar. Grassa is in PDX."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yegee L.","This restaurant is like a pasta factory, churning out fresh made to order pastas. It is a very small place so it's often hard to dine in and the line sometimes goes out the door. During peak lunch time around 12, it takes quite a while to get your order but the line dies down at 1.
The pasta is always very fresh, especially the tomato sauce options. The noodles are usually cooked al dente. They don't have a lot of options with protein but the two they have (spaghetti bolognese or gemelli w/chicken) comes with a good serving of their respective proteins. All of their pastas come with fresh grated Parmesan as well.
The truffle tonnarelli and the gemelli w/ chicken are quite rich & heavy. Even though I personally like the truffle tonnarelli the best, I do get tired of the strong flavor it has. If you're looking for a lighter more fresh option I would go with one of the two tomato sauce options spaghetti bolognese and the tomato rigatoni w burrata."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tazeen L.","Lunch spot with fresh pasta with interesting flavor profiles. This time around had the shrimp & chili bucatini which was tossed in a spicy, creamy sauce. Pasta was al dente and a pretty good portion, only part I didn't care for was the shrimp size which was similar to small salad style shrimp.
Place is pretty small with about a dozen seats, usually take it to go for al fresco dining. Worth checking out for a midday carb fix..."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kamara S.","The first time I came here, I was told that the worst day to come is Friday due to availability of ingredients. What days I come to this place... Fridays (yes I am a glutton for punishment).
As of fan of the sister restaurants (Le Messe, Haymaker, Raccolto, and others from General Harvest restaurants) I definitely wanted to try this one as it is for lunch and the prices for the pasta are relatively cheap.
This is definitely not a sit down place and while it has some seats, it is definitely a fast casual restaurant to probably buy food and take it to go. The place is definitely small that during the main lunch work hour it would definitely be packed.
There is a relatively small menu available but the options are good ones and the times I have been there, I see an additional special. Again, sometimes some options are unavailable due to availability (late Friday,
Prawns) but there are enough options to find something you would like plus one time they replaced a missing ingredient with something else and it went well.
It's a great way to get bucatini with clams or just tonnarelli with truffle and parm. Plus fried oysters or kale salad for appetizers (and relatively cheap). Plus, I am not mad at the portions. I could save half/a quarter after a meal if I want (but I am a champ)! Plus, they don't skimp on the cheese.
Overall, it is great for what it is. If there is space, you can sit down with a Pellegrino (blood orange) or a white claw (nothing too alcoholic because you may have to go back to work) and enjoy good pasta. Plus you get a map of the other restaurants in the company (not all of them are on there though)."

The lines get pretty long at peak times and the pasta takes some time to prepare. The pasta itself was pretty salty, but still good. They only list the main 3 ingredients in each pasta and exclude the fact there are onions and other bell peppers / veggies they throw in. I myself would have liked to have known that they include other ingredients for allergy info. That said, the pasta is good only if you like VERY AL DENTE NOODLES. if you don't, I wouldn't recommend."

The service is extremely sweet and I love the variety of the menu! I honestly don't know how they are able to cook so many interesting pastas.
Today we had the special of the day with tonarelli, rigatoni alla Bolognese (they were sweetly able to do this with rigatoni as opposed to spaghetti and removed chili pepper for my elementary school son), and bucatini with chili. All three were delicious--my favorite was the Bolognese. I could have this weekly and not get bored of it. The pasta was cooked to perfection.
This is fast becoming a new favorite the only drawback is I wish they had more comfortable seating especially for the price point :(. We lucked out and were able to get counter seats but have skipped out eating a couple of times when the restaurant has been overflowing."

The space is very small and there is a limited menu. Don't let this deter you though, we really enjoyed our pasta. I selected the pesto (as I am a vegetarian) and my spouse had the bologonese. My one complaint about our experience here was the pasta was on the tougher side of al dente, tasted more like ""just cooked"" and less al dente we expected.
They are very generous with the Parmesan garnish, which who can complain about that? Yum."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca T.","The pasta noodles themselves were made well and cooked al dente. However the pasta was just okay. We ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and the pasta of the day with tagliatelle (I don't remember what was in it).
There just wasn't any wow factor or anything that made me want to ever come back... However I may just be bias because I expect pasta to taste as good as il corvo and anything less is not good enough to me."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alice W.","Pasta here is decent and at a very good price, but definitely not close to il corvo in terms of the complexity of flavors. This store is open for dinner and weekends, though, so a decent alternative. Pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente, which I really enjoyed. The sauces are good but a bit muted/simple. We tried the spaghetti with bolognese and pesto. I like the bolognese better, especially since it had some spiciness. The pesto didn't have a strong basil flavor. We also ordered a piece of focaccia and the snap peas. The focaccia was nice and fluffy but because it's doused in sauce, the parts that weren't immediately eaten got soggy (so eat it right away!). Personally didn't like the snap peas. Half of it was celery and I didn't like that the cream wasn't fully incorporated so it was like curdled cream bits.
I would recommend stopping by if you happen to already be in the area but I don't think it's worth a trip if you aren't."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","Chef's Vendemmia is top notch. Haven't been to Raccolto. Le Messe is a toss up. Traffic - constant downtown Seattle face palm. Finally, visited G.H. Pasta located by nearby construction and parking hell late this afternoon (11/20/19). I cannot even fathom what this place is like when Amazonia and other downtown workers have lunch here.
The kitchen staff at 1400 were still slammed, like crazy busy! The slamming of dirty pans into the dish tub added to the din. High ceilings, bright windows with today's sunshine. Tight quarters counter space wise, but lots of takeout. Dirty counters (gave our area a good wipe down at the end). Empty water pitchers and initial icky red water glasses left around (eventually refilled with ice water once I placed them at front counter...note slammed staff).
Rigatoni with tomato basil and burrata tasty, but had to have The Homie polish it off at the end. He had the Tonnerelli with Truffle Oil and copious cheese. Rich and decadent.
I know it's practical to have compostable forks and bowls, but doesn't do the pasta justice when it's for here and not takeout. Very welcomed ice water once made available. Bus your area at the end. Treat it like a campsite. Leave it better than you found it, which we did. Eat it and go, no lollygagging here. Got a parting thank you as we departed.
For those pasta bowl cravings, still prefer Il Corvo in Pioneer Square, Pasta Casalinga at Pike Place Market, Due on Broadway/Capitol Hill, and Grassa in Portland OR.
Yet G.H. Pasta gets the job done, all things considered.
Hey chef, give all of the kitchen crew a well deserved raise! That is one heck of a culinary endeavor with a high volume throughput barely one step into the weeds."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lindsey S.","How can I say no to homemade pasta? I've had my share of homemade pasta from restaurants, and a lot of them are hit or miss. Sometimes the noodles are undercooked, and sometimes overcooked. This wasn't the case here - my noodles were cooked perfectly and had such a nice chew and bounce to them. I got the Bucatini with shrimp that was on their menu board, but was going back and forth between that and the Rigatoni. The sauce was creamy and spicy, with tiny shrimps scattered throughout. It was hearty, but not heavy, and just overall a good pasta dish, and maybe the best handmade pasta dish I've had!
The shop is super small, so there was a line out the door when I arrived, and line when I left, but I had no problem finding a spot to sit at. It seems that people just grab and go. After ordering, I waited five minutes, and they called out my number. It was hard to hear some of the numbers they were calling, because of the amount of people in the small space, but I was able to stand up front to hear better. They do everything in to-go containers, which I thought was interesting. They are sustainable, and most people DO take to-go, so it's understandable. Since it's so close to the Amazon Campus, lunch time is busy, but if you're looking for something to tie you over all day, these pasta dishes will do just the trick, just come early!"
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Caroline T.","Automatic 1 one star for having some 90s alternative rock blasting upon opening.
I'm not sure if they were behind because someone called out, or because of something else, but they seemed a bit rushed with opening/making sure things were out (ex: no forks at any of the seating areas). Cleanliness also seems to be a second thought, at least at the seating areas. All of the counters hadn't been wiped down, which was particuarly gross since the place just opened, which means it was left from the day before...
I was the first one in and only waited 10 minutes for my order. If you're dining in, they'll give you a little metal stand with a number and then you can choose your seating. (Plastic) Forks and napkins should be in the placeholders at the seating areas, and yes the pasta comes in the compostable bowls even though you're eating in. Once you're done, the recycling and compost bins are by the door, and there's a bin for any water glasses to be returned.
Thankfully the pasta was tasty, the sauce really was the winner. I went with the Rigatoni with Burrata, but found out after ordering they didn't have any but could sub in mozarella. Half the pasta was overcooked, but I'd prefer that over a soggy mess. Again, the sauce was really the winner and if they sold it I'd happily take home a jar. I was also relieved the sauce didn't have oil in it, as others noted some of the pasta dishes were swimming in oil.
With tip and no drink, my order came in just shy of $15. Not too bad considering this is Seattle, and it's within walking ditsance of the Amazon Campus and Space Needle. I may come back and try their bolognese, but I'd take it to go.
Lastly, I found it odd that even though I paid with a credit card the cashier was still typing in the details on the screen even though he swiped my card. Tad concerning when a cashier doesn't explain and the customer has to prompt them to.
Tips:
-Street parking (per the norm of the area), though be mindful where you park as the area has quite a bit of construction and is around several aprtment complexes. Thus, there may be stricter parking restrictions
-No set tip %, cash or credit is okay"
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin N.","My oh my, what a truly special place this is. Located in Belltown, this new spot is making a serious case for best pasta in the city.
I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. After ordering my food at the register, I was able to immediately grab a seat at the small shared table in the middle. Within 10 minutes, my number was called, and I went to the counter to grab my freshly made order.
I ordered the spaghetti with bolognese and an order of garlic bread. Typically, I'm not a fan of bolognese due to it being too sweet. However, this one was different. The sauce itself was very meaty, and it gave the dish a very satisfying, comforting feeling during my meal. And then the noodles themselves were so good. They spaghetti is thicker than the typical Parillo spaghetti you're probably used to, giving you a much more substantial bite. They were perfectly cooked to al dente - the outside still required a slight bit of effort to bite through, then the insides were super soft. They topped it with freshly shaved parmesan, which added a nice salty element as the cheese melted into the dish. By far, one of my favorite pasta dishes I've had in my life.
As if it couldn't get any better, the garlic bread was amazing. I got two hefty pieces, which was much more than what I was expecting. The bottoms developed a nice crust so that there's a brunch when you bite into it. And then the rest of the bread was super light. Topped with freshly shaved parmesan, definitely one of the best garlic breads I've had.
For how satisfying the meal was, it was very affordable. My meal was around $17, and I got a TON of food. Each pasta will cost between $11 to $14, which I think is pretty affordable compared to other places you'd go for fresh pasta.
The place is super small and located in one of the apartment buildings. It's tough to see from the outside, so be sure to follow your GPS. Inside, there's one small bar table that can seat 6, as well as maybe 10 additional bar seats. Wouldn't recommend coming in a big group, as seating can get pretty tight.
This is a super casual spot - no water service. As such, please be sure to bus your own spot. The bowls they serve their food in are compostable, and they have a tray for your used water cups.
Highly recommend this place - I'll be sure to come back to try other pasta dishes."

This is one of the only other pasta joints that is less than $13 per dish. We ordered the truffle pasta, and the spaghetti bolognese. Also with a side of the potatoes which were really crispy and delicious! The truffle pasta was so creamy and yummy i couldn't stop eating it!! But the bottom of my bowl was a layer of oil that was a bit sad. The spaghetti bolognese was good, I liked the sauce, a tad bit acidic, but the pasta was very al dente in a delightful way! For the price, this place is not bad at all, my friend I can with said Il Corvo is still better so I am determined to try that place! I'm glad this place is open on the weekends though, because Il corvo is not.

"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth C.","I've been wanting to try this place ever since it opened, and since I never come down to Denny Triangle anymore it's taken a while. It seems like a still-popular spot, as around lunchtime the line is sizable, but moves through relatively quickly. I waited in line to order for maybe 5 minutes? How long it takes for your food is pretty variable, though. It took maybe 10 minutes for mine, but I also saw large parties who ordered after us get theirs within 5 minutes, while my lunch buddy's food took more like 15-20. Obviously during lunchtime they are churning away, but just keep that in mind if you are looking for a ""quick"" lunch.
It's a counter service place where you can either get it for here (compostable containers w/o lids) or to go (same compostable containers w/ lids in a bag). If you can't finish your food, you can easily go up to the counter to get a lid and bag if you want. Silverware sits in containers on the few tables, as do napkins. You can serve yourself water as well.
Their menu is small with many seemingly permanent pasta items, a few appetizers, and a daily special pasta. I had the tonarelli with truffled sauce plus the fried oysters with aioli as an appetizer, while my lunch buddy had the rigatoni with tomato sauce and burrata, plus a focaccia topped with tomato, mozz, and basil. The portions here are pretty healthy, by the way; we both came pretty hungry and left very satisfied, appetizers or not.
The fried oysters were nice, but honestly not worth the price as they were quite small and they were only three that I counted. The tonarelli (a similar pasta shape to spaghetti) was cooked to al dente, well-coated in a sauce that was noticeably truffled but not one-note. As other reviewers have mentioned, this dish will reveal itself to be sitting in a pool of oil as you get closer to the bottom. I mean, yes, it doesn't look great, but just drain it out and continue enjoying it. A lot of these creamy white sauces combine cheese and oil to get that thick texture we all enjoy, so you're bound to produce some extra oil as the dish sits and cools down.
The focaccia my lunch buddy got was fluffy and delicious and came in a huge cube...and her rigatoni's tomato sauce made me feel like it was summer tomato season again.
Next time I would definitely try to get here earlier, but for the reasonable price on good quality pasta, I can see myself being a repeat customer."

My sister and I decided to try this place as we were in the downtown area and it was walking distance and we were craving pasta.
The inside is fairly small and probably can fit maybe up to 10 people. It's counter service so you order/pay first and then they will call out the number.
We got the daily special and the zucchini salad. The zucchini salad was pretty tasty. Definitely like the dressing that they use. It has a subtle sweetness to it. It was refreshing.
The daily special was pasta with cherry tomato, garlic, Swiss chard and parmesan. The pasta was strozzapreti which kinda looks like udon, but not as long and a little twisty. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente. They put in a generous portion of parmesan so it was very cheesy. The flavor was good, but I had to drink a lot of water because it was pretty rich.
Each dish was very simple, but the taste was just ok. Portion was generous though and pasta was cooked well."

It's taken me a long time to write this review, frankly because I want Artusi all to myself. The food is incredible and well priced, the service is informed and friendly, and the ambience is warm and cozy.
Food: My favorite always menu item is the meatball, it's on the HH menu and the dinner menu. Seriously, it's legit the best meatball of my life and I really try not to say that in my yelp reviews, but this one is seriously special. It's a little spicy, filling, and comes with a lovely piece of crusty bread. The pastas are made in-house and rotates seasonally. These guys service brunch too, and it's out of this world! The hash, the risotto, the bevvies! All legit.
Service: The staff here are friendly, warm, and experienced. They know their wine, make incredible cocktails, and make incredible recommendations. This is truly a neighborhood spot and this staff is what makes it really feel like home."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","Had been here a few times moreso for drinks and apps, but this past Monday we came for dinner. The pasta and wine night is divine. It is 2 pastas and a bottle for $40. I get skeptical about house red wine because it's generally on the sweeter side but this cab was perfect. We had about a glass left and took it home and enjoyed it the next day.
The pasta... yum. We ordered tagliatelle and gnocchi. The tagliatelle was a chicken one which I had never had before but it was good. Almost a pot pie flavor. The gnocchi had mushrooms and may have been my favorite gnocchi dish ever. My husband hates mushrooms and was even picking out the mushrooms to eat specifically. So tasty.
We also had some olives and meatballs. Meatballs are $5 each on happy hour which are a little expensive since they're not huge - but nonetheless very tasty.
It was an ideal amount of food and because of pasta and wine night, not expensive at all for what you get. Definitely recommend! But do expect a wait unless you get there right at open for pasta and wine night. We got there at 5:30 pm expecting some bar seating but every seat was taken and we waited about 40 min. We just headed over to Elysian a couple blocks away for a drink - which I recommend as well!"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Malia M.","WHY ARE YOU READING THIS INSTEAD OF EATING THE MEATBALLS ALREADY
Order 3 plates of meatballs because they're ridiculous.
I also rec the tagliatelle if its available when you're in
This place is insane in such a good way. Prices are reasonable.
Authentic, fresh and a chill environment. Great HH.
Drinks are strong, I love the seating in here and the paper lanterns.
Don't make the same mistakes I did: don't bring anyone here, including yourself, if the best Italian food you've/they've had is from Olive Garden. For example, if you're looking to bring your parents to a nice italian spot because they're paying for it, prepare for them to make some bad comments about really great food."

For Sunday/Monday nights - Come here and definitely check out the awesome Pasta Night special. At this time, it's a stellar deal of 2 pasta dishes + a bottle of wine (red/white/rose) for only $40! The earlier you show up, the shorter the wait. Came here around 5:30pm and snagging a table was pretty quick. By 630, entire restaurant (table/bar) was packed and wait time can vary between 30-45min+.
Food: Tried the special pasta with beef cheeks and this was absolutelyyyyy yummmms. Felt like the pasta melted in my mouth. Also, did try the Tonnarelli but wasn't a big fan of the noodles and texture. In the past, have tried the fried bread (so good!!!) and meatballs and these two remain consistently good. Overall, food here is yum and worth the visit.
Drinks: If you're not hungry but you're thirsty instead, check out the cocktails here! I tried a few drinks out and all were so so yummy. Can't go wrong with anything~~~~
In gist, love this spot for food and drinks. It's a bit of a walk from the hustle & bustle of Caphill but definitely worth it. Plus, if you want additional desserts, Regent Bakery is just right across the street."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lynden L.","We came as a party of 2 a bit after 12:30pm on Sunday for their Brunch Special ($35 for 2 entrees and a cocktail pitcher).
We did not have a very long wait (only as long as it took them to set up the table) as we came in as most people were leaving (finding a parking spot in caphill on a sunday took much longer!) and quickly sat down at a nice little table next to the window. The Brunch Special is what it is and we ordered the Risotto, Benedicto, and Apricot Collins.
Everything was beautifully presented and our server even helped us pour our first drinks from the ""pitcher"" (not really a pitcher, probably has only around 3 small glasses worth of liquid, including ice). The risotto was very interesting as it has a vinegary/sour taste, but overall we still liked it with the bacon crumbles and raw egg yolk on top. However, we did find that as it was served as a thin layer on a very shallow plate, the risotto did get cold quickly as you ate it. The benedicto was also great, as I loved that they used foccacia in place of english muffin, which soaked up all the lovely hollandaise sauce and runny egg yolk. It seemed lighter than your normal eggs benedict and left you craving for more as opposed to stuffed full of greasiness.
The apricot collins was refreshing -- not too sweet and just the right amount of alcohol. And what a pretty color as well!
Overall, we loved our experience but the portion sizes (for both entrees and drinks) are definitely on the smaller side. But the $35 deal is definitely a reasonable price in the CapHill area. This is probably great for a girls' brunch but me being a girl still found myself hungry afterwards and had to make a stop at Bakery Nouveau for a chocolate croissant to round out my meal."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marcela V.","This is one of my favorite spots to bring out of towners. It is Spinasse's sister restaurant, a little less expensive but just as good! They make all their pasta in-house and have some amazing plates. The best thing about Artusi is their pasta special on Sundays & Mondays. You can order two pastas and a bottle of wine for $40! It is a perfect place for date night. I definitely recommend coming early though because it's a small space and does full up quickly. The plates can be pretty small so I recommend ordering an appetizer or dessert to supplement the small portion size, but I can't complain too much when you're getting such a good deal. I will definitely continue to go to Artusi!"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek M.","The sister-restaurant to Spinasse. Cozy seating area with small tables that won't seat more than 4 comfortably. Shares a restaurant menu with Spinasse which is easy to access through an open wall on the way to the restroom. Food is just as delicious as Spinasse but the menu feels a little more condensed. Definitely the over-flow bar when Spinasse gets busy, but still offers the same quality food and service for smaller groups trying to dine at Spinasse without a reservation. Food is top-notch but don't expect a large portion of food. This is the place to go if you don't have a reservation at Spinasse and you have a group of 5 or smaller."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Victoria C.","This is brunch only
Good service here.
The risotto is great and pretty flavorful. Portions are good sized - not too much and not too little.
Pancakes were pretty basic. I didnt think the pancakes tastes anything special. I wasnt too big fan of the eggs - I didnt taste the crab too much
They have 2 meals and pitcher deal - 35$. I'd say the pitcher is about 4 drinks. Spritzer wasnt too sweet.
No bloody Mary's here if anyone cares!"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mei P.","I came to Artusi because a friend of mine suggested it's Sunday and Monday's dinner special where you get two (2) pastas and a bottle- yes a bottle- of wine for $40 total. What a steal!
I got the Maltagliati pasta that was made with beef short rib and bf got the Beef ravioli special. We also ordered a side of bread ($2) with olive oil as a starter. I really liked my pasta. The beef was extra tender! And the pasta was wonderful! I just wish there was more.
For the wine, we ordered the rose which was delicious. Very crisp and refreshing! I like my rose to be on the dry side and the one that was on selection was perfect.
The 2 pastas and a bottle of wine special sounds like a good deal but it ends up just breaking even in my opinion. The pasta and wine were delicious but there just wasn't that much food, especially if you were hungry before hand. A good place for people with smaller appetites that want to share a bottle of nice wine for dinner but probably not substantial."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ellen B.","I've only been to Artusi for brunch, but I'd love to return for dinner too. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at brunch. I wouldn't recommend Artusi for large groups- but my friends and I always do it anyways because we like to suffer and wait for tables. We had a table of 6 and we all opted for the Special $30 two food items + cocktail pitcher and split them amongst two people. I'm not sure if this is designed for one person to have two dishes and a cocktail pitcher or for two people because the dishes are just a tad too small portion wise for a good meal. However, the bonus of a cocktail pitcher for only $30 total makes up for it. Most brunch places in Capitol Hill will be $15 for your meal + $11-15 for ONE mimosa on top of that so this is one of the much better value places in my opinion. The risotto and the hash are my favorites so I'd highly recommend those two.
We all ordered different cocktail pitchers so we could try them all. However, the waitress was adamant that the cocktails needed to be served in the correct glasses and that we couldn't share because it wasn't possible to pour them into other glasses. So... we did it anyways behind her back. That was kind of a weird experience, but the cocktail pitcher experience was fun and we all enjoyed ourselves.
Overall I can't wait to return to Artusi for brunch again and also to try dinner!"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Daniel L.","Decided to try this place for happy hour on a weekday. Food is tasty but very pricy with tiny portions. Cost $5 for a single meatball, $12 for about 10 pieces of mini-ravioli. And the drinks are good but nothing special at high prices. Wouldn't recommend for happy hour as they didn't have good deals - it might be good for a date night though. We ended up going to another place after spending a lot of money here without getting full or drunk"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","JT T.","Artusi is definitely worth a visit for its pasta nights: 2 pastas (there are usually 3 or 4 on the menu) and a bottle of house wine for $40. This is a fantastic deal for the neighborhood and for the regular prices (~$20 for a pasta alone) at this establishment. That said, pastas (and all the dishes I saw) are pretty small, so order an appetizer or two if you're a normal amount hungry. The food itself is really nicely prepared and presented; everything was cooked well and had a good balance of flavors. Restaurant/bar is fairly small--for groups, I don't think they could seat a table of more than maybe 6-8 people--so go early on busy evenings (Friday through Monday)"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Travis L.","Recently visited with a couple of friends. We had an assortment of the anti-pastas and we also ordered the three main pastas and the special, as well as the meatballs.
The burrata was pretty good, not a huge fan of the minced zucchini but throw it on some bread dipped in olive oil and cuts some of the sweetness. Really enjoyed the Fra'Mani salame della sera. I liked the pears sugary sweetness with the saltiness of the meats.
The Tonnarelli and the special pasta of the night were very on point but found the risotto to be salty and gnocchi a bit dense. However, aside from those two critiques the flavor profiles were forward and pleasant.
Finally, had the tiramisu (off menu) for desert, very light, would have preferred a stronger mascarpone and cocoa flavor.
The food came out at a decent pace but our server could be reminded she's in the service business.
Regardless, enjoyed the atmosphere and might return but would probably rather just go to Spinasse."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Enquan X.","Food was pretty nice!
Had Happy Hour sparkling and snack(pasta).
I ordered the steak as main. My friend said I'm the bitch haha.
The steak wasn't in the right temp , plate was cold, cold plate for mid-cocked steak. That's the pity ! Steak didn't have much seasonings over, I assume it would rely on the right temp and timing to bring the good flavor. A hot/warm plate can be a saver!
Dessert was pretty, would be good for two 2 share.
Personal thoughts"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Shannon L.","Came here again - for happy hour this time. Maintaining the 4 star review. My biggest gripe is the portions are really small. My friend and I split the pasta of the day for $12 on HH and it was amazing, but very small. We also shared the fried bread and I was slightly underwhelmed by it. The prosciutto seemed more like turkey and I just found it more random than crafty and good. The house red we had from the happy hour was really good, too. Service pretty decent too. Just need to increase those portions!
Went for brunch today (a sunday) and overall a pleasant experience. First positive was that there wasn't a wait like there were for many other places in the area. On Sundays they have a special of $30 for 2 entrees and a pitcher (but really...a carafe) which was a decent deal. I would, however, warn that the entrees are not very big. I was content after eating but know several people who wouldn't have had enough with the smaller portions. Service was great though. Worg"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Summer W.","The perfect date night! On Sunday and Monday night, Artusi gives you the choice of two entrees and a bottle of wine for $40. Between their ambiance and the delicious food, it's a recipe for a great night.
Whenever I see the gnocchi on the menu, I say YES! It's the perfect pillow of delicious dumpling goodness. Try it and you won't regret it.
Pros: great deal (if you come at the right time), delicious food, fantastic service
Cons: limited seating, street parking"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rosa K.","It was a Friday night and we were actually meaning to go to Cascina Spinasse next door, they said the wait was 1.5 hours! I look over and Artusi is literally next door! It was about 8:30pm and we were starving and I have been wanting to try out Artusi so we decided to go there for a drink and light bites.
I got a glass of red wine and my boyfriend got an old fashion.
We said light bites, but I think we were hungrier than we though. We ordered the potato gnocchi and the braised pork belly.
I have had gnocchi before but I usually pick pasta over the gnocchi so I wasn't expecting to be wowed but boy, was I wrong. The gnocchi was cooked perfect. It had the perfect bite to it- soft and chewy. The lamb ragu was delicious and went perfectly with the gnocchi.
I was excited to try the braised pork belly. I have never had pork belly that was this tender before. The pork belly just fell apart. It was so tender, soft and just melted in my mouth. The 6 minute egg- the yoke beautifully would ooze out onto the pork belly. The culmination of the rich egg and the pork belly was magical. I would go back just for this dish."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex M.","I had the Tonnarelli Corti and it was delicious. The only part I didn't like was the pork cheeks- just not a fan. I also had the ""As I Lay Drinking"" cocktail and definitely get if you're into gin!
But, our server was sooo rude at the end. We asked if we could split checks and she barely gave us the time of day to tell us that they don't do it for groups of 6 or more. I totally understand that it's a rule, but our waitress handled the situation poorly."

Dinner is also really good with a good happy hour for food and drinks."
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kent L.","I got the risotto for 12 dollars. Definitely one of the best risottos I have had.

"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Arielle F.","I want to eat my last meal at San Fermo and I want it to be their bolognese. Seriously, this place is amazing whether you are going on a date, entertaining out of towners, or just in the mood for a delicious meal.
A few tips:
1. Always start with the bread and salted butter.
2. Order the burrata.
3. Order the bolognese.
4. Eat EVERYTHING! (This goes without saying.)
If the patio is open I highly recommend sitting outside - it's magical with fairy lights strung all around and there are heaters and blankets if you get chilly. However, they also have multiple beautiful spaces inside so there's really no bad seat in the house.
My SINGLE criticism is I've tried a few of their desserts - most recently the goat cheese cheesecake and a panna cotta drizzled with olive oil - and I haven't been especially impressed. To be honest I don't usually make it to dessert here anyway so it hasn't been a huge issue for me but if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend checking going elsewhere (Ballard is FILLED with great dessert spots, I recommend Hot Cakes)."

"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Klarke C.","This review is based around my experience for Seattle Restaurant week.
We had a reservation at 7pm and were seated promptly at near the front of the restaurant. San Fermo is located in a small White House in Ballard Ave and has a very cozy feeling! Although we were there for restaurant week, we couldn't resist ordering the charcuterie board and the buratta. Both are must orders if you're visiting. From restaurant week, I had the ceasar salad, spaghetti bolognese and the panna cotta! The bolognese was phenomenal and seems to be an overall favorite. It's also on the regular menu almost daily.
Besides the wonderful food, the service was a highlight. Our waitress was just not knowledgeable about the food but gave wonderful recommendations for wine. Try to Cupertino if you ever visit!
I will for sure be visiting in the future"
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Karen F.","Decided to give San Fermo another try because the pasta. God damn! I'm so glad we did. This time we had a reservation at 9:30 pm made on opentable but when we arrived the sign out front of the restaurant said that it was closed. We ventured forth and went in and the hostess hadn't realized we were on the reservation list I guess, but she agreed to seat us and said that it wasn't a problem. Our server was very friendly this time. He never once seemed rushed and we were able to enjoy our meal and a lovely bottle of wine without feeling like we were an inconvenience to the staff. The pasta's were incredible again. The pasta with short rib and blue cheese was ultra indulgent. This time the chefs even gave us a complimentary dessert before we left, some sort of mousse that was delicious. What a change the service made to our experience this visit. Would return again 100%"
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sean G.","Unreal FRESH and HOMEMADE pastas! This place was amazing and I will definitely be back and recommend to friends! We had the following and they were amazing!
Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese - pork, veal, rosemary, fennel, parmigiano reggiano
Unreal flavor from the first bite to the last!
Agnolotti del Plin - prosciutto cotto and goat cheese filling, nutmeg, culatta
These flavor-packed pillows were my favorite! Amazing flavor and texture
Short Ribs - saffron polenta, cinnamon, cloves, fried leeks, Demi glacé
The meat fell off of the bone and the polenta was a perfect match!
Bruschetta - smoked rockfish, squid ink aioli, pickled peppers, lemon oil
The smoked rockfish was SO FRESH and had wonderful flavors!
House Caesar - anchovy, parmigiano reggiano, red wine croutons
Smothered with fresh cheese and the anchovies had a nice salty taste!"
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael C.","While walking around Ballard and considering dinner options, my friend Joe and I walked past this cute Italian restaurant and checked out the menu. The top item on the Primi & Secondi menu caught both our eyes and we had to get some.
Built onto what used to be a house, there is the intimate front room, a gorgeous patio, and a deep back room as well. I feel all have their pros and cons, so if an option take the back patio, but sitting in the front room and seeing the open kitchen is also a treat.
The menu is robust enough so that anyone could find something, while not being so overwhelming.
From the Antipasti my friend and I decided to split the House Caesar. Really tasty! I really appreciated the whole anchovies that really added to the experience and made you know this place was legit.
While the crab risotto and grilled pork belly did catch my eye, we both got our own Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese. I love saffron, I haven't had good spaghetti in a while, and the mix of pork and veal really called to me. What we got was this beautiful plate of spaghetti covered in sauce and then with a wonderful layer of white cheese. It was very flavorful, and while the bowl isn't huge, the amount of food is deceptively filling. My friend Joe even had some he took for lunch the next day.
All in all a great experience from the staff to the ambiance to the meal itself. I would gladly come back whether with friends, on a date, or even on my own."

They should give lessons in how to compose a ceasar salad. Bravo. And on a cooler blustery autumn day, throughout enjoyed the turmeric mushroom pasta at brunch.
Great service to boot.
Only knock, somewhat limited brunch menu!
For dinner, make reservations, or wait an hour. Simple as that."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julie A.","The one star is for the ambiance. It's a cute space in a great location.
The food was fine, not amazing, not terrible - unremarkable and overpriced. I don't mind paying $$$ for really good food but this was just not it.
The service was sub-par - maybe because our server was new (she wasn't knowledgeable about the menu) or maybe because they charge an automatic 20% service fee so there's no incentive to provide great service - the tip is guaranteed.
The worst part? The hostess, Meredith. From the first unwelcoming interaction when we arrived, to the last when we were leaving, she stands out as the low point of this entire mediocre experience. Meredith was so incapable of handling a ""stressful"" situation of people backing up in the waiting area that she lost all grace and was completely rude to her guests . Just a reminder to Meredith - you're not saving lives, you're seating people at tables. Get it together.
With so many other great options in the area, don't waste your time and money here."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Shanna L.","First time here. 2.5 stars but rounding down for the reasons noted below.
San Fermo is situated in an incredibly charming house turned restaurant. The interior decor is warm, both in terms of vibe and temperature. We thankfully were able to sit outside for our meal because it was uncomfortable inside -- and the patio was lovely.
The food here is pretty good - but not sensational, and painfully overpriced for what it is.
We ordered 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 2 entrees (the cheaper of the available options) -- and no drinks -- and spent approximately $100 out the door. That should raise your eyebrows.
Portions are astoundingly small in relation to the price. San Fermo seems to want to go toe-to-toe with the worst aspects of dining in Manhattan, despite being situated in Ballard. That said, I've had way more satisfying Italian meals in Manhattan at this price point...
$14 for one piece of burrata. Menu description suggests it is accompanied by a wondrous array of vegetables and flavors, conjuring images of a satisfying spread. It wasn't much more than thoughtfully assembled, surely with culinary forceps. Didn't even come with a small piece of crostini, literally. See picture.
$14 (I think) for a nectarine salad. Nectarine *wedges* were huge, and were barely dressed or accompanied by the other items listed that we looked forward to (basil, endive, mozzarella - for example) and so tasted more like a fruit plate than anything else.
Now for the entrees: got the Bolognese (which the waitress touted as the restaurant's most popular dish) and a squid pasta dish (I'm forgetting the exact name). The flavor profile of the Bolognese was not nearly as sophisticated as I would have hoped given its popularity. It really lacked any underlying element of freshness and was heavy and monotonous. It was also lukewarm at best when finally delivered to our table (see below). That said, the squid pasta was excellent and truly offered a window into what San Fermo can do extraordinarily well.
Again, very small portions in relation to the price. It's not just small plates and small amounts of pasta. San Fermo doesn't even give you the protein item you expect in your pasta in any meaningful way. The particles of pork/veal were indiscernible vis-a-vis the sauce in the Bolognese and were largely indistinguishable. And there were only tiny squid ringlets. The amount of protein in both dishes was laughable, especially at $22-24 each.
I'd say their entrees, relative to other similarly situated Italian restaurants in Seattle, are approximately 25% - 33% higher.
Worst of all, we waited nearly *FORTY-FIVE* minutes between the time we finished our first course and received our pastas. The waitress was unapologetic and made it seem like this was just a reality of their restaurant, attributing it to the size of the kitchen. If that's the case, do not come here hungry. The last thing you should experience in any restaurant is a feeling of palpable hunger.
Everyone around us had already received their food. It felt like they forgot our order and didn't own up to it, which is unfortunate given that it's a relatively small restaurant with a relatively small menu.
The waitress told us that it would be another 10 minutes (ended up being closer to 20) and handed us a what was probably half a sliced baguette as a consolation about 30-35 minutes into the wait, even though we didn't want it earlier when she offered it (that's another $5, by the way). A more genuine gesture in light of the circumstances would have been to offer a primi or a glass of wine on the house. Didn't happen, and clearly management either wasn't involved or wasn't concerned.
There is an automatic service charge on your meal - and the service reflects that. Our waitress did not refill our water even once. We had to flag her down at every turn; she maybe visited our table four times of her own initiative, twice for greeting/taking our order and once for (expeditiously) bringing and returning the bill: the only fast part of the experience - a telltale sign. (Someone else brought our food.)
The most insidious part: San Fermo assesses their service charge BEFORE assessing tax, whereas most restaurants imposing a service charge do so as a separate item in lieu of gratuity. So, you pay tax on your tip, too. And the lackluster service was the cherry on top.
Sadly, we were here for a special occasion. The restaurant knew that in advance based on the reservation and even called my fiancé beforehand -- and they did absolutely nothing to enhance the experience.
We genuinely felt awful leaving the restaurant, despite the fact that it was supposed to be a celebration. We just moved to the neighborhood and were really hoping to love (and frequent) this place. Alas..."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tami G.","Popped in here on a Monday eve with no reservation and a party of three. They were happy to seat us outside on the adorably Romantic
Patio they have and couldn't be more obliged to make sure we were cozy and warm multiple times throughout the evening.

It was a great experience- would eat here again and super glad we popped in."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wei H.","Having moved from Chicago, I whine a lot about how Seattle has no decent Italian food. Now I can finally say I have found my favorite pasta in Seattle. Friend and I got a glass of wine each, the endive salad, the carbonara, and the bolognese. The endive salad was fresh, crisp, and ideally acidic to work our appetite up. I loved the bite of the carbonara. The bolognese was just perfection in every bite. That meat sauce was complex and smokey and chunky and ahhhhh I don't even know what adjectives to use. If you eat meat, you HAVE to get this.
And yeah, the ambiance is quite cute and romantic, especially in the attic (roomy and airy, don't worry). But I am desperate enough to just go there alone to devour an entire thing of bolognese."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kay N.","I came here on a Friday night (they do accept reservations). This place is very intimate, cozy and relaxing atmosphere. It seems like they renovated a home into a restaurant. We got a corner table in the attic. Even though, I said the word attic, trust me, it doesn't feel like an attic. I like their light fixtures up there.
Their menu rotate daily with a couple of staple dishes.I ordered one of their staple dish, the spaghetti bolognese. My boyfriend ordered some kind of a seafood stew dish, like a cioppino. For appetizers, we ordered their antipasto board and got their bread and whipped butter dish (which is pretty good). The antipasto board had high quality meats and cheese and we were pretty happy with it.
I really liked my spaghetti dish, they made it really well. It was flavorful and the pasta was the perfect texture. My boyfriend liked his dish as well, but I think he wished he ordered pasta instead. I mean it is an Italian restaurant!
Overall, the service was great, pretty attentive. Great spot for Italian food in an intimate atmosphere."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mitchell V.","I've always said that I don't love Italian food. This is a personal thing I am dealing with it. I enjoy Italian food but I hardly ever crave it.
That being said, I have to admit I really did love this place. First things first, this place is really quite expensive. The pastas are easily $8-10 more than other places that also offer handmade noodles and sauces. However, the place is super cute (ideal for date night) and each room feels unique. The service is warm, kind and extremely helpful.
I really did love the quality of the pastas and sauce. The bolognese was great. I've had a lot of truly great bolognese and I really enjoyed this one. The dungeness crab bucatini was exquisite. A lot of seafood pastas will overload on garlic or cream to mask the not so fresh seafood but this let the crab shine. It had the right amount of lemon, butter and crushed black pepper to make a perfectly simple yet extremely delicious plate of pasta.
Also, I need to mention the Caesar salad. Wow. I love Caesar salads and I appreciate when they are anchovy forward (it is a fishy dressing, afterall). This was perfectly dressed with a wonderfully salty, fishy, anchovy-y dressing that will leave me thinking about it for some time. One of my favorite Caesar salads in the city, hands down."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Geana N.","Our expectations were a bit higher for this lovely house restaurant with access to the Sunday market fresh vegetables and proteins. We're a bit disappointed in a the dishes we've tried so far.
Specifically the egg sandwich with arugula salad and the pasta dish (and I added a poached egg). The sandwich had more bread than filling and we found that a bit off putting even though the egg was nicely cooked and rich in of itself. The sandwich needed more protein to stand up to the richness of the egg, the thick bread, and the spicy arugula.
I had the pasta dish and while it was a good dish, I was not blown away by it like I thought I would be. It was a tad, bland. I wanted to like the dish much more but it was just ""good enough"".
The drinks were made well. We liked the mimosas and in fact ordered two each because they were really delightful for a sunny Sunday brunch. There is a bar here, and perhaps next time we just stop in for a drink or two.
One cool thing about the menu is that it changes weekly with only a couple items that remain as staples. Perhaps these dishes just weren't for us. We have visited twice now and have walked away wanting. We'll probably give the food one last try and if it's not great, we won't return."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia L.","This is a cute and cozy restaurant. The exterior looks like a residential house painted in white. Once you step inside, immediately to the left is the kitchen. And to your right is a small town of seating, and there are more seating further in the ""house"" as well. The staff are friendly, but not overly so - you'll be left alone to enjoy your meal except for drink refills when necessary. I would recommend the burrata - very soft, fresh, light, and well complemented by the sweet & tart flavors of the diced apple plus balsamic vinegar. Additionally, the light and citric acid flavors of the burrata dish goes well with their housemade focaccia bread. I would also recommend the spaghetti bolognese. It's creamier than the typical bolognese sauce with savory and hearty pork + veal in each bite. For dessert, I tried their tiramisu. It's quite uniquely flavored with pumpkin mascarpone and cinnamon - personally, I wasn't a big fan of the dense texture of the mascarpone as the bottom layer of the tiramisu or the cinnamon mixed with cocoa powder flavor. Nevertheless, I had a lovely dinner experience."

We had a nice enough dinner. The food was good. Enough. But not over the top. When we stated that we were hungry but not starving we ended up with way more food than we indicated we wanted to the waitress. But all that aside - we had a lovely ambience. Until this extremely intense woman showed up out of the blue - whom we hadn't seen prior - and aggressively told us that we needed to move immediately as they had a reservation coming up and she stomped away. This was after we were at our table for a little over 2 hours. We were deep in conversation and were taken completely off guard. It was a harsh and abrupt ending and unexpected. We won't be back."

This place definitely has that rustic Italian vibe. Its charms blend in perfectly with the historical Ballard feels. Great place for a date night or brunch date. The homemade pasta was fresh. The combination of wagu beef and bone marrow really intensify the beefy flavor. It was a interesting fusion. Keep in mind that the pasta is in Italian portion not American."

We were sat upstairs in the attic which was super cute. I could see it getting pretty hot up there but there was AC units so we were good. I have been there 2 other times and didn't even know there was an upstairs. I've sat inside and on the deck which are both great areas as well. Our waiter Zak was the best! So nice and really took care of us. He Recommended the best stuff and everything was delish with our 2 glasses of rose. See photos for all the great things we got. Very good Italian dinner spot and I will def be back."

The decor in the cute little house is perfect. I love sitting on the patio. I love the pastas, but when I'm not that hungry, I love the appetizers too.
Perfect place to come eat in the summer (or during the rest of the year, really). One of my favorite restaurants in Ballard."

The outside of the restaurant was what pulled me in. It looks like a tiny house (super cute). I sat outside and it was all very hip. The food took a long time but it was worth it. The egg Benedict and the carbonara both tasted FRESH! With a first bite, you know it was not from a can. Everything was so amazing and I would love to come for dinner one night!"

He asked me how my food was the last time I was there and even made sure to speak with the kitchen that night to ensure the dish I wanted was spot on. I was really impressed with his level of customer service and the delicious drinks he whips up!
I am taking away one star because the consistency of the meals is not what it should be for a 5 star spot. Definitely a place I'll come back to though. Thanks Russel!"
"Rione XIII","https://www.yelp.com/biz/rione-xiii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth S.","Updating my review -- last time I was there was several years ago, so things can change. But I am sadly taking away a star from Rione.
I remember in my last review raving about the bread -- of which there was none this time around. Our pasta was... fine. I once again got the Cacio e Pepe, remembering how good it was from a few years ago, and it was, again... fine, as well as the artichoke appetizer, also fine. It was VERY salty -- so if consuming salt is an issue, this isn't the appetizer for you.
I am sure there can be off nights for places, and so this evening was that for us. Our server was very nice, and I do think I'll visit again when I'm in Seattle. Four stars is still a really good rating -- but I can't maintain the 5-er I gave them before."

It's a really nice spot on 15th Ave E in Capitol Hill which is really one of my favorite little areas in Seattle. It feels like the perfect mix of neighborhood and city and this place is exactly that!
Some of the things I especially like from HH are the Fried Gnocchi, the buratta, there was a tripe dish and a buccatini I really liked. Sorry if that's not that helpful.

It's a complex, dark, red spicy tomato sauce and I will absolutely crave it! I scooped some extra sauce onto the gnocchi-it's so good.

"Rione XIII","https://www.yelp.com/biz/rione-xiii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Camille J.","My boyfriend and I stopped here for a late dinner and were pleased to find that their kitchen was still open at 10pm. We got the chicken liver mousse bruschetta to start and shared the bucatini and fennel sausage pizza. He got a whiskey sour with egg whites (extra $2, though he thought it was worth it to take the drink from $9 to a reasonable $11), and I got the Sicilian bramble, which was just a delightfully refreshing drink. Nice and fruity but not fake tasting - an ideal balance.
I loved the bruschetta. First of all, it was served with 4 large pieces of fluffy bread. The bread was perfectly done - crisp crust that wasn't so hard it would cut the roof of your mouth and soft inside. I usually expect some measly little crostinis or small pieces of baguette at nicer places like this. To match the thickness of the bread, there was a thick layer of mousse on top as well, making this actually quite a large and filling dish.
The bucatini was a little too al dente for our taste, and I typically enjoy my pasta al dente. Just maybe a wee bit less al dente. The sauce was good though, albeit a little salty, especially considering how salty guanciale already is. When we finished the pasta, the waitress suggested that we keep the leftover sauce to dip the pizza crust in, and my mind was blown. I feel like it's usually the opposite situation - where I want to keep the sauce on the plate but it's swept away before I can say anything.
The pizza was also a hefty serving. The sausage wasn't too salty and was very tasty. The crust was a little soft, but overall the pizza was delicious. We were both very happy with the meal, the service, and the restaurant overall. They also had a great playlist going on."

The fried polenta gnocchi (my fav dish), the fried risotto with ragu, the two pastas, and the two pizzas we tried were all worth the splurge. Everything was well seasoned and perfectly prepared. We also tried the fresh beans with ricotta and pistachios, and fried artichokes - both were delicious. The salad was a large serving of very fresh greens. Even with all that, we also ordered a dessert to share. I can't stop talking about the warm pumpkin cake with spiced pecans, sauce and ice-cream. We all went nuts. And it was large enough for all five of us to have a couple of bites each - all we could manage considering the feast we just consumed. The service was as good as the food. What a fun and delicious meal."

We got the fried artichokes as an appetizer. It was solid and the aioli was pretty good. For the main dishes we got the hot coops pizza and the carbonara. The pizza was wood fire and delicious. The toppings went well together and it was a good size for one hungry person or two to share. The carbonara was excellent and a huge portion. The pasta was cooked al dente and the egg yolk on top made it even creamier and elevated the texture. It definitely could have used a little bit more salt or seasoning, but it was still delicious. The service is great and our waitress was very friendly and nice. Will definitely be returning and will be part of our Italian/pasta rotation."
"Rione XIII","https://www.yelp.com/biz/rione-xiii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dana R.","Over the past few years, the food and service at this place has declined significantly, which makes me sad as I used to frequent quite often.
Went last night for the first time in about a year (after tossing in the towel) with some friends who suggested it ... we hoped that things had improved. Nope.
After waiting at our table for more than 10 minutes, we finally asked a passing employee whether we had a server and she my goodness has he not been by ... nope. She then at that moment kindly took our drink and appetizer order.
Our server showed up with the wine and made no apology or any acknowledgment that he left us hanging for so long at the outset. He then proceeded to be snarky throughout service.
Wine was fine. Artichokes were over salted and had very little pangratto. The fried risotto with beef ragu and mozzarella was good.
The winter squash ravioli downright bad and was sent back ... predominantly muddy flour water taste ... bizarre for a dish of the type I order frequently.
Both the carbonara and cacio et pepe pastas lacked flavor and tasted watered down. The guanciale in carbonara was chewy, bloated and unrendered.
The Amatriciana pasta was good after a friend doctored it up with her own calabrian chili oil for more flavor.
Ordered baguette with olive oil after an extended discussion with server about whether we wanted focaccia ... focaccia arrived anyway ... didn't see the bill but we indicated we didn't want it and they told us to keep it anyway ... too much honey in the butter according a friend who tried it.
Much better Italian in the area ..."

I love that their menu has a wide variety of fresh, fried, grilled, and everything in between. Many things on the menu i had never heard of, such as fried gnocchi --i love finding new things! I did not get any of the pastas or pizzas this time, but will definitely be back to try both with friends, as one serving of either is quite large!
The staff is very friendly, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. At the tables were large families, couples on dates, friends. There were also some individual people at the bar just reading, and I love a place where I can feel comfortable just to come alone if I want. I also loved the painted pink flowers in the restroom and the painting of cakes, yum! Thank you Ethan Stowell, for another restaurant to add to my happy hour and dinner list :)

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

The server was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. I really enjoyed everything about dining here.
The issue that I have is that I got food poisoning from their squash pasta. It was delicious when I ate it, but about 90 minutes after I finished eating my stomach began to churn and it continued into an extremely unenjoyable experience. Luckily, my friend had their mac n cheese, which she said was delicious, so she did not get sick. Aside from the bad squash pasta, this is a cool place with a great location. Just be mindful with what you order because it may not sit well."

I imagine if it's super busy it might be a little slow, both food and service, in our case it was timely in both areas.
It was seat yourself when we arrived, which always makes me nervous! It takes attentive staff to properly serve tables they have no idea are seated! The bartender did a great job though, catching all the tables on his continuous circles through the seating area. We stayed awhile so got to see the night staff arriving and the place filling up. The entire staff was super friendly and checked on us regularly.
The wings, the perfect, wings! We ordered several appetizers between the two of us to get a sampling of what they had to offer. Everything was spot on and delicious with some great flavors. The first order of wings was perfection on a plate! Hubby and I gobbled them up pretty fast! We then had to order more, they were that good! Sadly, the second order came out a little under cooked. Same great flavor but definitely needed a few more minutes of heat!

For happy hours, everything is 50% off so I got like 2 bar appetizers and a drink for $15.
The food are all delicious and their drinks are also pretty on point. Their Bloody Mary is awesome. But watch out Ms. Rachel the bartender because she has a heavy hand haha. She tends to give you quite some alcohol in one drink.
A little hip and quirky vibe. Attract a lot of musicians to come here hang out. Overall it is a really cool place!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

It has a funky atmosphere.
Nice happy hour menu; it has something for those who are watching their diet and those who are not. Truffle popcorn is fabulous. The mixed nuts have a Sweet covering. The dates were warm and stuffed with goat cheese. Wonderful hummus.
The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.
The cocktail menu is small, but good. I like the wine and beer menu. The prices are very fair. The service has been wonderful.
Great spot; great time. Come visit."

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"

My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."

Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"

Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"

The area around Pike Place is incredible now that the viaduct has been demolished, and I hope local businesses benefit from that. I loved the Zig Zag Café, excellent drinks, good food and great staff. Our server was very friendly and very accommodating when I realized too late that I had ordered something that didn't agree with my tastes. Much appreciated, and I won't wait so long for my next visit!"

We had deviled eggs, the pork skins, and almonds and olives for snacks before dinner at Cutters. The eggplant dip with the pork skins was the highlight. It was silky smooth, and not like baba ganouj, if that's what you were thinking. There's an off-menu cocktail-with-a-story, if you're interested. Called the Chas, it's bourbon, Cointreau, and other potent tastiness. A Pike Place institution, you must come to Zig Zag if you're in Seattle."

So many fun drinks and yummy snacks. They have one of the most extensive cocktail menus I've ever seen and it was hard to decide on just one (okay, two) to try. For snacks we had the fries which have a great balance of salt and dress black pepper and the crispy pig skin which came with a fantastic aioli.
We arrived around 5:30 and were able to get a seat on their small patio, but the inside looked nice too if the patio is full."

We also ordered the Mezza Plate, which was hummus, tzatziki, watercress & shallot spread, dolmas, feta cheese, grilled pita, cucumbers and house pickles.

It is very low-key and unassuming, but don't underestimate the quality of the food and drink! The three of us enjoyed our pre-show meal and only had to walk two blocks to the performance. I will add this to my short list of favorite places to eat in Queen Anne especially when going to shows at the Rep or McCaw Hall!"

Sadly, reality didn't hold up to my memories. Potato still cooked well, but it was barely lukewarm. Wish they would have heated it up a bit.
Kale/brussels sprouts salad was a tasty pile of fresh veggies and sweet dried cherries. The kitchen is very generous with the dressing, so may want to order it on the side.
Overall, OK, but might try a few other places in the area before I return."

It was the first time for my friend and I and she got the ""Forager"" and me the ""Sweet Potato."" We both really enjoyed our dishes minus a temperature issue. My potato dish was scrumptious but lukewarm. If it was piping hot and service wasn't excruciatingly slow this place would definitely get four stars. Our server disappeared to go on a smoke break, never offered another glass of wine after the first and pretty much just went on his merry way. I understand that Solo is very chill and laid back but a little more service and we'd be in the four-star zone."

It looked like there was a show going and the doors are right by the stage instead of in the back by the bar, we decide to go in and find staff to see if we can still order and are met with staff chastising us because the door says there's an event going on. Sure, the sign said there was an event in progress and we read it, it didn't say the place was closed off entirely. We'd never been there before and were hoping we could still get food at the bar or somewhere in the back.

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

The vibe of the place is really relaxed and inviting. It felt like a really fun place to be. The service was great, drinks and food came out in a timely manner. The server was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. I really enjoyed everything about dining here.
The issue that I have is that I got food poisoning from their squash pasta. It was delicious when I ate it, but about 90 minutes after I finished eating my stomach began to churn and it continued into an extremely unenjoyable experience. Luckily, my friend had their mac n cheese, which she said was delicious, so she did not get sick. Aside from the bad squash pasta, this is a cool place with a great location. Just be mindful with what you order because it may not sit well."

I imagine if it's super busy it might be a little slow, both food and service, in our case it was timely in both areas.
It was seat yourself when we arrived, which always makes me nervous! It takes attentive staff to properly serve tables they have no idea are seated! The bartender did a great job though, catching all the tables on his continuous circles through the seating area. We stayed awhile so got to see the night staff arriving and the place filling up. The entire staff was super friendly and checked on us regularly.
The wings, the perfect, wings! We ordered several appetizers between the two of us to get a sampling of what they had to offer. Everything was spot on and delicious with some great flavors. The first order of wings was perfection on a plate! Hubby and I gobbled them up pretty fast! We then had to order more, they were that good! Sadly, the second order came out a little under cooked. Same great flavor but definitely needed a few more minutes of heat!
The drinks are creative and tasty with some different combinations and names that make you want to try them. From the food to the service and the window seat sidewalk watching, we'll definitely be back when we're in the neighborhood!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

Nice happy hour menu; it has something for those who are watching their diet and those who are not. Truffle popcorn is fabulous. The mixed nuts have a Sweet covering. The dates were warm and stuffed with goat cheese. Wonderful hummus.
The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.
The cocktail menu is small, but good. I like the wine and beer menu. The prices are very fair. The service has been wonderful.

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Tom B.","This is one place where you really can learn a lot just by looking at the photos. You can see hearty Italian food, fairly traditional, presented beautifully in a nice dining room. That's a good summary of what's on offer here.
This is one of many strip malls in block after block of strip malls on the way down to the Edmonds ferry. There's just enough parking (barely).
Inside, everything's just nice enough--you're not paying for a bunch of fountains and premium real estate, but the whole bar and both dining rooms are pretty. Dimly lit, nice earthy paint colors on the walls, fun vintage ads, nice furniture and table settings. There's not much of a lobby, and the place gets busy. They don't take reservations, either, so you might be waiting outside if you come during the rush.
The menu is fairly short. Lots of classics, almost always with local ingredients and some creative touch from the chefs and cooks in back. There's a wine list, and a few beers on tap and in bottles. Full bar, too.
For food, one server pointed out that their special list really is the creative heart of the kitchen. What they feel like cooking and the ingredients they're most excited about are what shows up there. The regular menu has tons of stuff you want, too, and it's where the starters are. They're always welcome with any meal.
The food here runs to a hearty, home-cooked vibe. Some of the ingredients are a little fancier than your average home dinner, but they slow-cook the sauces and give you big portions; you feel like your grandma is worried you're not eating enough, so she gave you this. Not only is it a big serving, but it's something she figures you'll eat every bite of even if you're getting full.
Even the lunch portions are huge, by the way. The dinner portions blow those away. You could easily order fewer entrees than you have people and share plates, especially if you get starters.
We had the caesar salad, which has real caesar dressing made from scratch in house. With eggs. Real caesar! I love it. You can get anchovies, and you can wear your server out waiting for just the right-size mountain of fresh ground black pepper. This is a proper way to start a meal. They're also constantly bringing you out some really nice bread.
We got a bottle of a local cab for $35, from Virtue. It was an amazing bargain at that price, and suited the meal perfectly. Their headquarters are close to Edmonds, too, which is cool.
For entrees, we had the Pescatore Romano, which was a mountain of shellfish and a little finfish on squid ink pasta. The Tre Ragu was a heap of elk, lamb, and something else on big noodles. Both came simmered in garlicky, herby tomato sauce (I assume slightly different recipes). We couldn't finish all the fish, but the meat dish was all gone, right down to the last of the sauce sopped up with still more bread.
We missed the desserts and after-dinner drinks, but this was a huge hearty meal served quickly and presented beautifully for less than most places charge for such ($135 for 4 total plates + wine). This would be an easy place to get addicted to. We'll definitely get back."
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Vy P.","This place was a nice surprise! My friend and I were craving some Italian food and we decided to check this place out. I had not heard much about it and, *surprise*, I didn't even check Yelp before going... Everything was quite with a small hiccup in service.
LOCATION & PARKING //
It's in this very small and dark side plaza in Edmonds (across from PCC). It's not very well lit from the outside so keep an eye out if you're using Google Maps or something. I had to make a small u-turn once I realized I passed it. The location itself is small but cozy. There is parking in a private lot so I wouldn't worry about that.
FOOD //
I got the FARFADELLE ALFREDO with CHICKEN. I love anything with alfredo so I figured this would be a good choice... and it was. First of all, the other reviewers are correct. The portions here are huge. I only ate about 1/3 of my plate and took the rest for home. The pasta was smooth and buttery. The sauce was not too overwhelming and it was the right texture. Some places make these dishes too ""saucy"" but I felt like there wasn't a pool of sauce on the bottom. In fact, the sauce just coated the pasta, as it should. They also give a decent amount of chicken too! Best part? The pasta tasted just as delicious as leftovers.
I also want to touch on the complimentary bread... because it was super soft and fluffy. Seriously, go for it.
AMBIANCE //
Like I mentioned before, it's small and cozy. I didn't expect that from here. It's strange to say, but it reminds me of a cozy inn in a small town. It's a great spot for families, dates, friends, etc. The entire vibe is very intimate.
SERVICE //
I feel quite conflicted about this because the service from the servers was absolutely fantastic. I never felt rushed to order or pay the check and they consistently checked up on us. My concern here is how we (and other customers) were addressed and seated. When we arrived, there was a man who seemed to be in charge of seating everyone. We weren't acknowledged for 5 minutes and when he walked us to our table, it felt like he was annoyed at us/servers in general. It was quite strange.
OVERALL // 4.5 stars
I had a great experience here and will consider coming back if I'm craving some Italian food. Not sure what really happened with the small service problem though..."
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Kellye M.","We had the caprese salad, bolongnese alforno, tortellini con pesto. Everything was excellent. Liked the bolongnese the most. Truly spectacular. We also had the cannoli cake. That had to be the best cake I've ever had. It was moist. The frosting had a nice orange flavor and it was just delicious, and I don't like cannoli.
Nice family atmosphere. Very homey. Staff was very friendly. Keely was an excellent waitress. Will definitely come again!"
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Annie Y.","I just love this place. The owner of the restaurant is always around and you can sense the dedication in the food. Everything we've ordered so far was delicious and plentiful. Service has always been friendly and unobtrusive. We love to get one of the specials when we visit and it's ones of those few places where you can't go wrong with anything you try. They have a relatively small kitchen but they dish out big flavors. Super impressive, a standout in the neighborhood."

Waitress was kind enough to bring me more plain pasta and glass of water, but could not help much with the ready made sauce."
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Shaylor S.","Most authentic Italian place I've been to. Was pretty skeptical with this place because it is a bit pricer and I wasn't sure it would be worth it. Mamma Mia I was very wrong. Guys!! Come here.
I got ""the grinder"" not really knowing what it was going to be like. They came out with a literal canoe-shaped thing of bread that was perfectly cooked, crispy, and fresh. It was filled with multiple cheeses, very unique cut of salami (my absolute favorite), tiny onion bulbs that were still intact but cooked and caramelized to perfection, and a bunch of other flavorful things that made this one of the best Italian dishes I've had! I was really hungry and I couldn't even finish it! Had to take the last little bit home because it was so good. Portion sizes parallel the price you're paying so don't let the price deter you too much.
The other reason this place is 5 stars is because the service here is unmatched. They focus on the little things like making sure your drink is always filled up, replacing the appetizer bread (that is free) before you can think to ask for more, giving everyone a mint at the end, giving you a full rundown of their specials, having thick towel-like napkins, going out of their way to thank you for coming in, and so much more! For me, those little things go a long way.
Some big things they do is hook you up when you misunderstand what you ordered. One of my friends thought they ordered something that had a similar name to something else and when they brought it out she realized it was not was she ordered. The waitress took it back and within five minutes she brought out the correct one. It wasn't anyone's fault but they took on themselves to make the customer a priority. We were all very pleased.
The only thing I didn't like was the water because it tasted a little like plastic. It was only the first couple refills that had that taste. But besides that, I got nothing but positive stuff to say!
Great Italian atmosphere that is authentic, hospitable, inviting, packed with freshness and flavor! They just do it right here."
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Mona M.","I'm no Italian but I felt right at home. I felt like we were treated like a family even though it was our first time here. They made us feel like our business is important to them and that out presence mattered from the moment we entered the restaurant until we walked out that door.
When we arrived at the restaurant for an early dinner, there were several people waiting for a table. The owner Anthony happened to be entering the restaurant at the same time like we did. He smiled widely, greeted us and held the door open for us. The two of us were able to get a seat immediately. Bread is served as a starter as you browse through their menu (olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table). Our waitress was super nice and all smiles. She made recommendation, checked on us a lot but mostly gave us our privacy.
We got the half salad upon her recommendation, portion is actually huge. I could overhear our waitress saying the same thing to other patrons that the Caesar's salad is the best that she has ever had. But I agree that it was indeed very good. For meal I got Di Mare Puttanesca which was their squid ink pasta served the entire habitat of the ocean in it. I mean seriously my plate came with a generous helping of lobster, tuna, rock fish, mussels, clams, calamari, octopus, and prawns swimming in a spicy marinara with capers, anchovies, and Kalamata olives. Dear God the portion is HUGE! Meanwhile he had the Carbonara Antonio with smoked pork belly bacon which was delicious though a little on the salty side.
We weren't able to finish our meal because we got sooo full. Nonetheless we couldn't pass on dessert. We opted for Spumoni as it would be easier to swallow than cake. Well, I love the spumoni. We got three scoops and it was not too sweet.
Excellent service with great food. I definitely enjoy the vibe here. It seems like everyone knows everyone, truly feels like being among friends and family in here. Parking can be tough, but they mention there's another nearby parking that you can park at (I think it was at the bank or something.. I can't seem to remember the exact details now - please call the restaurant for details.)"

I lived in Italy for 2 years and returned back to the States 9 years ago. I'm always a little... or a lot... let down when I try Italian restaurants because it's just never the same as the real thing. This is the first Italian place since Italy that I have loved! No complaints. I'll even let the chicken Alfredo dish slide since I understand they have to appease our misguided American demand.
This trip made my 4th of July weekend. Great food, great service, fair price for the quality and quantity you get. I wish I didn't live 3 hours away. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the I side is nice, and their attention is on the food...none of the flashy stuff.

It was good and we need to finish it before it turns cold so please plan to share it . We also got the Di mare puttanesca which was huge portion of seafood with ink pasta. There were more mussels and only few shrimp and just 1 piece of small lobster tail which was disappointing. The pasta was chewy probably could have been cooked a bit more. These 2 dishes were like 4 star but I am giving 3 star because of the kid dish. The kid's pasta was so chunky and undercooked with a TBs of shredded parmigiana and butter. My kid is a good eater and won't complain much, trust me it was so bland and bad. There was like 3 kid's option and I am not sure what others tasted like. I am rating this 3* just because of kids menu. We were the only ones in the restaurant but still no cutlery even after 7-8 mins after lunch was served, they apologized for the same still I feel it should have been done right considering the restaurant was empty. We enjoyed food though just not my kiddo."

Bucatini is a hidden gem tucked away in an Edmonds strip mall. The low lit, romantic wine bar is home to 5-star eats from beginning to end. It truly was a perfect dining experience and I need to write this review while it's still fresh in my mind!
Oddly enough I didn't order a pasta dish. I know what you're thinking, ""Matt, are you okay? Is something bothering you? Why aren't you consuming pasta 24/7?""
I'll tell you why. Typically at a fancy Italian restaurant, I would 100% order a composed Italian pasta dish. However, Bucatini has...get this...a Heroes & Grinders menu! Any good Italian knows the immortalized significance of this. I am so, so happy with my decision to order ""The Grinder.""
The Grinder - Capicola, Mortadella and Calabrese Salami w/ Grilled Caramelized Onions & Provolone on Toasted Ciabatta. Say hello to heaven, folks. This sandwich had it all; salty, savory, sweet, cheesy and crispy components that worked phenomenally. Plus, the sandwich was the size of my head. Have you seen my head? Yeah, it's that big!
I'm also not one to praise a salad, but the Caesar Salad I ordered prior to my sandwich was a 6-star salad. Homemade dressing, whole leaf lettuce and deliciously addictive croutons, with a squeeze of fresh lemon elevated this salad into a beautiful starter.
Service was stellar. Our waitress knew the specials like the back of her hand, filled every glass, and was continuously one step ahead. The owner even came out to talk to us and the other tables, which is always a memorable touch. Cannot recommend Bucatini enough!
Do you ship grinders to Jacksonville? I'll pay for overnight shipping."
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Jodi B.","Have visited Bucatini's a few times now since recently moving into the area and the food never disappoints. I've never ventured outside of pasta with regards to what to eat, but also why would I? It's amazing! Bucatini Alla Napolitana is a personal favorite, delicious, the Polpi Nona is also great, but on the specials so unsure how often it's available. They also just expanded and doubled in size, which is cool to see for a local business.. You should definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!"

Either both. Place is awesome. The only thing I forgot was to add a bottle of wine. (An option even to go). The selection is great and extremely reasonable. Thanks guys. My dinner was delish!
Back today to grab grinders for workers. Everyone loved them and wanted to know where they came from. Two of them enjoyed The Steak Grinder and said it was the best Steak Sandwich they had ever had in their lives. Thanks Bucatini for a great meal and making me look good! Awesome as always."

Marinara pasta had a bright flavor and was completely consumed. The bolognese was delish! We helped my daughter clean the bowl. House wines by the glass went well with the meal.

We waited for about 30 minutes till being seated (which I think was relevantly short compared to others) and we ordered immediately since we had plenty of time to browse over the menu.
We decided to go with the Steak grinder, Bucatini alla Napolitana and the Bucatini with Homemade meatballs. Warning: that is A LOT of food for just two people and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. During dinner the severs and the atmosphere reminded us a lot of home and everything was right up our alley.

"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Mohamed N.","""Delightful Italian in slightly out-of-the-way strip mall""
We came here with a group of 6 on a Friday night at 6pm and were fortunately able to be seated in this rather small place, though the restaurant filled up very quickly thereafter. The restaurant is at the end of a strip mall with very limited parking, but there are signs noting that you can park at a nearby bank. One of my party has a severe legume/ soy allergy, but as with traditional Italian food (but unlike some chain places), this restaurant only uses olive oil and occasionally canola oil.
The setting is a bit dimly lit and cozy but not TOO crowded. The servers were quite attentive-- our glasses never fully emptied, and both they and someone I presume was the manager checked on us repeatedly. I was still full from lunch so I just ordered a caprese salad. My dining partners got the caprese classic sandwich, a different salad, or the Di Mare Puttanesca. We had delicious bread while we waited (refilled as many times as we wanted), and there was olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table.
The food was DELICIOUS.
The caprese salad was a bit small, but exceptionally well done. It was exactly what I wanted. Probably not meant to be a meal by itself, but a good appetizer.
The caprese classic sandwiches were the salad in a GIANT half-ciabatta, and decorated with a cute Italian flag. Everyone loved them, and the bread soaked some of the balsamic and oil making it also delicious. Pro-tip: do NOT order this sandwich toasted-- it comes out like a giant crouton. It's nicely crispy without toasting. This will fill up a hungry eater for sure.
Our friends enjoyed their puttanseca and salad immensely too.
Overall, an excellent local, out-of-the-way option for high-quality Italian food. The price is fair for the high quality-- definitely a significant step up in quality, food presentation, and ambiance from Olive Garden and such (though I like those too)."

"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","LeAnh N.","I've been holding off on writing a review for too long. Altura holds such a special place in my heart. Wholeheartedly I am telling you, this is my absolute favorite restaurant in Washington State. Not just Seattle. I've traveled around and tried tasting menu in different regions and always find myself comparing it to Altura.
My partner and I went to a tasting menu location elsewhere that was top notch. They offered real grated wasabi in front of us. Somehow Altura still managed to peak over that experience. The food is phenomenal! We love Chef Nathan! We love the staff!
Every experience has been so intimate and personal. If you go here please sit at the bar! I hate sitting at bars at any other restaurant but at Altura. You get to see the magic happen, and some of the time the chefs make it in front of you and deliver it right to you. Also when som thing is so good I like to ask the chefs a few questions about the dish.
We've been here so much we're able to pick up on conversations that we've left off with some of the staff. They remember what we like, what we don't. They remember all the times we've been here.
My partner and I celebrate almost every single celebration here at Altura. Sometimes we come with no celebration, just because we miss the food. I don't feel like words can describe how amazing Altura is. Sometimes I still can't believe it exists in Seattle.
There's a lot of fancy restaurant around that gimmicky. However there's just something lacking about it. Altura to me, is like a Diamond in the rough. Let's be real, you're not gonna get a super spacious table with cushion seat that looks out into the Seattle skyline. What you will get is phenomenal food and an unforgettable experience. Theres no valet, but there is food made from the best season ingredients.
If you ask me, a dinner should be about the food. So I would choose Altura's quality food and staff over valet and views any day. I'd rather have an intimate experience from a small restaurant filled with attentive staff than an impersonal experience at a restaurant. Where the staff only comes to give me my food, refills my water, and to give me the bill.
I recommend this place to everyone I love! All my friends and family knows that this is my happy place."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle C.","I was lucky enough to be able to find a 2 people table on the day. They required a $100 deposits per person to book the reservations, just as a heads-up.
We like most of the dishes, but we also feel like it's more for the people who like strong flavors. It has a total of 14 courses and we just couldn't finished all since it's just simply too much, especially since the taste of each dish was very strong. I ended up feeling sick at my stomach when I left. But it didn't mean the food isn't good. Just that I'm not used to having strong tasting dishes continuously within a short time frame.
Service is ok. They have the waiter/waitress serving the dishes but there was a period of time where I couldn't find my server at all since he is the only one that I could make my order with.
We sat right next to the window, which was freezing so if you have a chance to have other seats, definitely do that.
The wagu beef was great but it's costing an extra $20 per ounce on top of your prefix menu, which I found a bit obscure.
I think in general, the food is good, but at this price point, I just expect more from this fine dinning place."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sara V.","Went to Altura for a special occasion dinner with my husband in October. While the food was definitely good and on its own worthy of at least 4 if not 5 stars, I don't think it was worthy of the price. I also don't think the service, decor, and ambience match the price tag of this restaurant.
I actually found the stuzzichini to be the most exciting and interesting part of the menu. Lots of interesting flavors and combinations. However, as the menu went on, we became less impressed.
We also had asked to have a paper copy of the menu since we find it helpful to be able to read about what we're eating and hard to process in a loud restaurant when served each course. Once we had one paper copy, put on the side of the table out of the way, at least 4 employees asked us over and over again if they could take it (one person even asked us twice). I understand that the restaurant might prefer that each course is a surprise but at the end of the day, we are the paying customers and I feel like it's a small ask.
I also found the tables to be very close together for the caliber of restaurant and price of the tasting menu. I was not asked if I wanted a second cocktail as I sat with an empty glass for two whole courses until I finally decided to ask myself without being offered. Again, not a big deal in general, but not the attentive service I would hope for and expect at this price point. Unfortunately, would probably not return given the numerous other options in Seattle."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Daniel C.","If the Michelin folks ever decide to come to Seattle, I'll be willing to bet that Altura deserves a star or two.

Folks do need to decide on the main course (duck breast or wagyu), and whether to supplement the pasta dish with white truffle (~$80/gram). You'll get the smaller bites coming out quickly, and them things slow down toward the larger portions, main, and desserts. The cuisine is Italian but with a Pacific Northwest twist. The food is gorgeous and the flavors really popped.
1. The first dish of fermented potato and cured sturgeon roe set the down and blew everyone away. Potato like a smoky cloudy foam of flavor, which played nicely with the salty roe.
2. Next came this trio of clam, razor clam, and a really meaty oyster. Although served in their shells, all three were cooked by poaching and then chilled. Nice surprise and full of briny goodness.
3. Uni Cannoli was probably the most luxurious finger food ever. Listed as savory, I found this more decadent and better than a regular dessert cannoli!
4. Next came a trio of beef dishes that may have been the Chef playing mind tricks. A soft beet (not beef) sponge cake topped with smoked beef tongue. Then a pumpkin crostada with beef fat filling. Another fried
eggroll-like dish with beef crudo.
5. The duo of mussels was up next. One served in a container from the smoke of Madrona bark and the other with a nice creamy sabayon.
6. I liked the next dish of prawn served in its broth with black rice. Prawn was almost lobster-like in texture. We were less impressed with the fried shrimp heads, designed to be dipped in the broth. A bit too oily compared to Japanese Tempura-style shrimp heads.
7. Before the main course there's pasta, and its always better with some shaved white truffle. 3g for 6 people is enough and is worth splurging for. Chef Nathan Lockwood himself shaved them for our table, which was awesome! Although we did not choose duck for our main, we got a chance to taste it in the pasta along with fried sage and porcini!
8. Everyone loved the main course selection of Wagyu. Very juicy and flavorful. Less impressive was the caramel radish which I found a bit too firm. The radicchio with foie gras snow added some nice bitterness and richness
at the same time.
9. The palate cleanser before dessert was duck tea,
which reminded me of SF's Saison. A bit too salty IMHO, but my sister seemed to like it.
10. Lastly, two excellent desserts. A Creamsicle sorbet made with sumo oranges and crispy meringue wafers that dissolve on your tongue. Then, this really impressive affogato with aerated hot chocolate. The side of orange zest gelato turned out to be the boozier dessert!
Definitely recommend Altura as one of Seattle's finest restaurants. Service, creativity of dishes, and flavors are hard to beat!"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mia C.","Wow. Wow wow wow. This was one of the most exceptional culinary experiences I've ever had. Each bite was so perfectly balanced, and I left this meal of small bites completely satisfied. My favorites of the night were the foie gras rolls, prawns with foam, pasta with truffles (lemme tell ya - these truffles were spectacular and so so fresh), and smoked mussels. I had no idea what I was eating half the time but that was all part of the fun! Definitely save this for a special occasion at $500 for two!"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","April P.","Intimate and cozy ambiance. Satisfactory meal but missing the wow factor. I have noticed that fine dining establishments in Seattle are missing the creativity that is found in fine dining dishes in Europe and Asia. I have a shellfish allergy and I always appreciate when a restaurant will go out of their way to accommodate my allergy. My replacements contained vegetable dishes which were tasty but they all tasted very similar. I'm not sure if the other Stuzzichini or dishes containing shellfish were outstanding or not. The pasta was my favorite. Amazing pasta and the white truffle added on is worth the extra charge. They were generous with the white truffle. I chose the duck breast for my main course which was good but once again nothing memorable. Dessert was delicious. I enjoyed my meal but I did expect more."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Grace D.","This was one of the most interesting meals I've ever had. From eating popcorn with a fork to the savory cannoli, the tasting menu is extremely creative. We frequently asked staff questions that almost seemed idiotic, but they're professional to a tee. They have all the answers about the menu's creation, components, and sources. And they have great mustaches. We didn't do the full wine pairing, but we did take recommendations for a glass to start with and end with. Despite my date not being an oenophile, we both enjoyed the recommendations. Looking back, I'd make the same decisions.
I can't believe they fit us in without a reservation on a Friday night but it was such a fortunate happenstance- the less fancy place we expected to go was uncharacteristically booked. The space is intimate, giving off an active yet calming vibe. It's a modern, simple background for a baroque culinary tableau. The meal experience took two and a half hours, exactly as staff said it would. I thought time flew by. We started hungry then ended stuffed- when they brought out the second dessert course, we could barely handle it. However, their aerated hot chocolate-based dessert is so worth it!
Some of our favorite pieces were the pillowy gnocchi, stunningly plated in red with fruit and beets. Even the palate cleanser sorbets, with tarragon and fruit flavors, were delicious on their own. The locally sourced crispy duck was perfectly fatty and seasoned. Of the stranger pieces, we both loved the fermented potatoes with black butter. At the beginning, we were hoping for bowls of everything, but no course disappointed and we left fat and happy. It's also sweet that they send you off with a box with a little shortbread and chocolate truffle and a menu to remember things by.
I'm still surprised Yelp categorizes this place as ""Italian"" because that's not apt for the diversity of flavors and inspirations here. Though there was gnocchi, a savory ""cannoli,"" and a vaguely Italian dessert, this place is New American fusion in my mind."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kayla N.","Unique and tasty foods. We did their tastings menu and classic wines pairings. We enjoyed all of the foods. It's amazing what the talented kitchen line produced. They did all sorts of dietary accommodations which can't be easy. Luckily, we have no allergies and were able to taste their offerings adulteration.
Service was friendly. Our only ding would be the wines pairings but this is particular to our wines tastes.
I would recommend anyone to give this restaurant a try. What a treat to experience unique and distinctive dishes."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Daniel F.","Meal was fine. Staff was informed in advance that my wife has a serious hazelnut allergy. They told us upfront she'd get a different dessert as a result. Nonetheless they served her the hazelnut dessert. First they apologized after she tried an obviously hazelnut bite and pointed it out. Then they said it's maybe not hazelnut, as her throat started to constrict. After a minimal subsequent apology, we escaped.
Perfectly fine meal. Pretty unbelievable that this was the service for a nearly $1k check for 2. Thankful she avoided anaphylaxis. Sigh."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jonelle T.","Altura has been on my list for a while and we finally stopped in a few months ago during their celebration of shellfish.
Located on the quieter north end of Broadway, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside, yet cozy and casual on the inside. The décor is eclectic and the space consists of a long bar and just enough tables to still give you an intimate dining experience. The multi-course menu is fixed and changes seasonally. The food may look fancy, but you don't have to worry about fine dining protocol here.
Think about your experience here as a well thought out masterpiece. From the stuzzichini to dessert, every course was thoughtful in its composition and plating. After all, you eat with your eyes as much as you do with your stomach. While creative, every dish was still approachable, with a twist on familiar ingredients.
Our meal began with a flight of amuse-bouche style bites, including a spicy blood orange and parsley soda that packed a punch. We devolved into courses like beet sponge cake with maitake mushroom and white truffle and beef crudo with parmesan fondutta and quail egg yolk. A play on a savory cannoli with uni had promise, but was overwhelmed by chives. One of the more interesting courses was a fermented potato with black butter that just melted in your mouth. The aforementioned shellfish was delightfully presented, but very sandy, while a satsuma and sea buckthorn sorbetto proved to be the perfect palatte cleanser. Our duck was so perfectly cooked, I could've easily eaten another plate and a winter herb brodo hit the spot on a cold winter night.
Though a bit on the pricier side, I think it's worth the experience for a special occasion or just a nice night out."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle L.","Taste: 5
Value: 4.5
Service: inconsistent
The good: Altura is a Michelin contender (if the team ever makes it to Seattle!) for sure given its elaborate fine dining experience from the beginning with the rapid fire courses (deliciousness in single bite form) to the flavors of their decadent desserts. I also appreciated the decor and that the chef actually hand crafted most things in the restaurant (tables included).
The bad: Altura is not quite ready for that Michelin star rating. For one, I didn't get a good story of celebrating Italian cuisine from our main course. Both the lamb and duck options (which by the way could be eaten in one single big bite...not sure how you can call that the main course) were on a bed of vegetables that were seasoned in more of an Asian inspired fashion. I just didn't get the connection. Secondly, their service needs work. Maybe our person was new, but he made several mistakes that interrupted the dinner service (I've never had servers take back unused utensils before at such a high end restaurant because we needed something else to eat for next course).
Maybe with a few adjustments, Altura can climb it's way to the top of the fine dining scene."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Allen A.","When we walked in and sat at the chefs counter, I observed a kitchen in harmony, preparing delicious smelling/looking food. I looked over their wine list(very fairly priced) and ordered the wine pairing for the 14 course tasting menu. The wife and I loved the balance in the menu starting out light and working its way to red meat. No course was too heavy on meat or seafood, and every flavor blended in perfectly within each course. Service was better than amazing. The chefs were personable, and I was gifted extra rounds of drinks. The wine selection inspired me to buy a bottle to take home. The Italian love put into the food made the course structure worth it. At the price we paid, we felt that the food was a steal. We will return 100%
(if only there was a 10/5 star option on yelp to accent the quality)"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Reza A.","My wife and I don't usually do fancy dinners out, so I'm by no means an expert in the finest cuisine. But we had a special occasion to celebrate and decided to give Altura a try. And given the hefty price (dinner for two was $500 with two glasses of wine and gratuity) the most important question I can help answer: Is it worth it? And I think the answer is a resounding yes!
The service was excellent, but I think that's expected. What was less expected was the ingenuity of the courses, the wonderful taste, the fact that we had to make almost no decisions other than provide our dietary restrictions and preferences and were very positively surprised with every meal that was brought out.
Make sure to make reservations at least a few weeks ahead of time and don't be shy to share all your preferences when you make your reservation (they are very nice about avoiding things you can't eat). If you forgot, that's ok, I had forgotten to let them know to avoid dairy when I made a reservation and o lot told them during our visit and they did a great job to accommodate the courses.
Great for a romantic dinner for two but we saw larger groups with up to 6 people and they seem to have a great time.
Big fan!"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Missy S.","After making plans to travel to Seattle, the first thing on the list was finding a nice restaurant to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. I ended up being torn between Metropolitan Grill and Altura, but ended up picking Altura despite it having less reviewers and a lower rating. The food at Altura looked more inventive and I was interested in having something different. I know my intro is very long, but I think it provides context. I think it's necessary to highlight the importance of meeting the customers expectations when they seek a dining experience that matches the special event being celebrated.
1. The staff is wonderful. They were professional, courteous and efficient.
2. The food is inventive and the ingredients are high-quality. The duck-best I've had and the wagyu steak was pretty darn perfect. I will say that of all the courses, I only enjoyed the pastas and main entrees, the rest of the apps didn't taste good at all and were only satisfying to the eye. The dessert was good too, but that's expected. You can't really mess up dessert.
3. Presentation was spot on and the timing of the courses was very well executed. The dishes were all specially designed for the courses and it's something I appreciate.
Now for the disappointments:
1. Rating: In Seattle, the food quality standards are described using face emojis. Excellent, Good, Okay, Needs to Improve. I was shocked to see that Altura only had a ""Good"" rating. It was the first thing I saw and it was very off-putting. I read the description for ""good"" and it's not good. Basically it's possible that Altura has some red-level violations, just not enough times to get an ""okay"" rating. Anything below the top for this kind of restaurant is again, unacceptable. Clean up your act Altura.
2. Punctuality: My husband and I arrived at 9pm and didn't get seated until 9:42. Just not acceptable for a $$$$ restaurant. Reservation made far in advance with a mandatory $200 deposit have to be prioritized and 100% timely. I can understand 15 min.. but nearly 45 min late.. ridiculous. I will give credit where credit is due, the host offered glasses of Prosecco as a mia culpa.
3. Venue: The restaurant itself is nothing special. The place in general is very unkept and it doesn't seem like much of the money the restaurant makes is invested back into decor or maintenance. There is no waiting area.. something they need if they're not going to be timely. There are a couple of chairs near the host bar and whoever sits in one of them will have coats hanging over their head. The baseboards are dirty and pretty beaten up. You can tell they only clean where they have to. There's no white glove standard here. The mirrors have streaks and there's dirt and dust under the parts that the broom or mop can't reach. The bathroom is also unkept and pretty subpar for such and expensive restaurant.
I took pictures, but they seem to have the same menu posted several times by others so I'll spare you with the exception of the food rating chart.
If you're looking for your experience to match the high cost, skip Altura."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kate N.","Throwback to such amazing experience at @altura on my birthday. Probably the best fine dining in Seattle that I've ever had: perfection from the service, ambiance to excellent tasting menu. I kept being impressed every time new dish coming out :O . Beautiful presentation and creative combinations make everything so delicious and worth the pay!!!
P/s: Though I never expected to be full eating at fine dining restaurants but all those small bites from @altura actually made me pretty stuffed for the whole night!!"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stella D.","The creative ideas and the ambience and customer service are exceptional. No condescending look if you don't want wine matching. Very swift and punctual throughout the dinner. But do expect a 2.5-3 hours dinner since waiting for food just takes a while.
But the taste of the food have big swings among the dishes.
For $137, we get about 8 appetizers, 5 entrees and 3 dessert. Out of 8 appetizers, there are only 2-3 that actually taste normal. Some of them are way too salty, some of them are just a combination of weird flavors. I don't even know how you can make food taste so bad. The conclusion I get is they are trying too hard to be creative. It ended up the ones that have simpler ingredients actually taste the best... Even though they might look the most exciting.
The 5 entrees are generally pretty good. The celebration of winter shellfish is good other than the clam is not salty. The Gnocchi is amazing to smell and taste since we sat at the counter. The steak is definitely a highlight. The quality of phenomenal and it is cooked to the optimal tenderness and flavor. No wonder no more entrees after the steak.
The dessert is okay. Liked the bourbon caramel semifreddo the most but overall a bit too sweet. It was my birthday so they used the chocolate sauce to the draw out a happy birthday message on the last dish which is cute.
Overall good experience will recommend it for special occasion but definitely not coming back."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ben C.","Altura has long been on my list for an indulgent dinner and I finally took the opportunity to make it out here last night. I've been to more tasting menus than I can count and the experience here feels slightly different than most, which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you prefer.
The space is really small (hey, this is Seattle) and while it doesn't really confer to me a full tasting menu experience a la Michelin like others claim (not that that's necessarily what a chef aspires to), it's really cool to see what the team is able to do with such limited space. The tabletop coal fire was placed right in front of me and was used throughout the night-- it was interesting to watch the duck breast hang over the fire and absorb some of the smoke wafting up to it and to see the oysters being grilled. The open kitchen concept comes with its potential pitfalls, though. When the team has to huddle and catch up it's awkward as a patron to see obvious conflict/turmoil happening.
The number of small bites could have made a full meal by themselves, but the amount of work that went into each was obvious. Some courses were a miss for me-- the shellfish and surprisingly the cheese courses I didn't really enjoy. The cooking was good enough to *almost* make me like olives. Most courses though were really enjoyable-- I'd kill to know how the fermented potato course was made as well as how they made the ragu so damn good. The affogato course gave the experience a feeling of a proper closing. This is the only restaurant outside of Eleven Madison Park that I've been to that is bold enough to make a dry-aged duck course, which was done extremely well.
Overall I'm super happy to have come here and hope for the business's continued success. Really, I just want to eat the dry-aged duck every night for the rest of my life."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sara R.","I've been back three times since my initial review back in 2016, and I can scarcely remember that I ever had bad service. The food and the service have all been outstanding every visit since then, and even if there was a dish that wasn't my favorite, it was always balanced and made sense. Seattle is all about simplicity so we are lucky to have a restaurant that isn't just about simply good food, but good food that is a true experience."
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joop V.","I was at Altura to celebrate a friend's birthday and, now that I have relocated to anothet city, it was definitely one of the most aesthetically, tastefully and ambiance wise, memorable meals I had in Seattle.
The menu is a fix prixe multi course and changes regularly depending on available ingredients, and you can opt for optional courses like truffle/cheese or steak plate s and/or pairing drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic options). We had the multi course meal (everyone who went to the restaurant had to pretty much had the same thing here...with some accommodations for dietary restrictions, of course), added on the truffle/cheese course and got the half alcoholic/non alcoholic and another non alcoholic pairing.
The courses were all wonderful. They were beautifully plated and all tasted great. There wasn't a dish that I didn't enjoy honestly. I think what helped too was the portion of each dish was right. It was light and wasn't too much in quantity that you ended up feeling stuffed over the course of the meal.
I also appreciated the staff with great service mind. Even though it was a high end restaurant, the staff was friendly and there wasn't a stuffy atmosphere at all. In fact, the ambiance was intimate and they really took the time to pace out the meal and cater for each table (I knew this because we sat at the bar so we saw a bit of actions/preparations that went into their work!).
Overall, I loved the meal there. Altura will definitely be among my top picks for Seattle for those looking to celebrate special occasions.
P.S. if possible, get the bar seating of you are inclined to also observe some kitchen show and definitely make a reservation ahead of time!"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jack Y.","I visited this place when my mom came to see me in late September. We had an amazing experience, and here are the pros and cons I see:
Pros:
1. they have a nonalcoholic pairing option, which is very friendly for drivers.
2. most of the dishes were super great, and we found many of them having interesting and also enjoyable tastes.
3. service was good and very quick.
Cons:
1. I ordered their 4oz wagu steak. The steak is definitely not the top grade that would melt in your month. The taste is closer to the Australia wagu (they said the steak comes from Hokkaido). Also there were some vessels in the steak which were hard to cut. My mother had the dry aged duck. I also tasted a small piece and I felt it was a bit over cooked and dry. I don't know if it is potentially related to its dry aged nature. But in general I feel the main dishes (both beef and duck) were the least impressive ones in the whole course.
2. I asked for a table, and they placed us at the corner table which is right below the stairs. It was noisy every time someone used the stairs. There were planety of other tables empty but I don't know why they put us at that particular table."
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ojus P.","Very strong pasta and sauce. Would be happy to come back.
Ate at the bar on a Wednesday night. Gets a cold breeze every time someone opens the door so I'd advise getting a reservation.
Bruscetta - 3/5. Crispy, slightly burnt bread. 3 dips with a decent olive tapanade and cheese.
Melanzane - 4.5/5. Crispy, cheese filled eggplant. Really rich and robust tomato sauce. Well salted. Light pasta at the base adds variety in texture. Very well executed."

Did hit the carb craving though and I definitely finished off my app... had scallops for my main which were a decent portion, well seasoned and quite tasty. Others had mixed review on entrees though... Pain came with service alllllll night long. Items forgotten, waitstaff rarely checking in ( so constantly had to flag down which took surprisingly long given the relatively empty dining room) and on occasion having a bit of an attitude. Definitely didn't get the bread other reviews have mentioned.
Probably will not be making a return trip given the other strong Italian contenders but I suppose I get the local appeal if you live in the neighborhood. Also maybe the sister restaurant is worth a try given the reviews..."

Probably an honest mistake but I was the only table that didn't receive bread.
Lasagna: I've had better frozen lasagna than this. The cheese was burnt to a black crisp and left a bitter taste in my mouth. The marinara sauce was watered down. Sacrificing quality for quantity.
Rigatoni Bolognese: The pasta is made in house. Al dente. Great but the only thing I tasted was salt and pepper.
Chocolate Cake: It sort of tasted like chocolate but if you blinded folded me I don't think I could tell you what it was. Also, fresh blueberries will always be better than frozen blueberries.

We came for lunch on a Friday. Open doors, inviting tables, good customer service. A lovely Italian moment. The bread and garlic olive oil is a great starter. I highly recommend getting a pasta dish!"
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley K.","Ended up here by accident because Cicchetti is closed on Monday (now you know that fact as well). But they share a patio with them, so you're not at a total loss.
During happy hour on Monday, it was a 15-minute wait for a patio spot on a sunny summer day, so if that's your calling as well, be prepared for a potential wait, especially if you've got more than two.
We were hungry but not famished and ordered the cheese plate and the meat board. Both were amazing, and the server's knowledge of the various eats was impressive. The different options were so varied, and the accompaniments were great. I wouldn't change a thing. The pate was especially good.
To drink, I had one of their roses, again the waiter was super helpful in describing them. My companion got a cocktail that was amazing, so you can't really go wrong on the drink options. I'll be back!"

This is one of my mom's favorite places to come to lunch, and my first time coming to this restaurant. The overall experience was good with delicious food. The host took my jacket and our waiter began taking our drink orders almost immediately. It was dinner and it felt a little cramped with spacing however my mom reassured me that the atmosphere during lunch is better. Although it felt a little cramped, all of those thoughts quickly disappeared as soon as I took one bite of the food.

What we ordered:
Cozze: Mussels, smoked tomato, harissa, and sweet vermouth.
Polpo: Braised octopus, fregola sardo, finocchiona, peperonata, parsley, and smoked chili emulsion.
Rigatoni Bolognese: Anderson Ranch lamb, fennel sausage, marjoram, and Pecorino.
Lasagna: Lamb-pork ragu, béchamel, ricotta, and Grana Padano.
Agnolotti dal Plin: Duck confit, sage butter, roasted chestnut, and balsamico.
Latticello: Buttermilk cake, coffee mousse, marsala, amaretto caramel, orange, pomegranate, and espresso tuile.
Nocciola: Chocolate hazelnut tart, strawberry sauce, and hazelnut praline semifreddo.
Affogato: Vanilla gelato and Illy espresso.
--------------
The highlights of the meal: Cozze, Rigatoni, Agnolotti dal Plin, and Latticello.
Overall delicious food, even the house-infused oil that you dip your bread into was so savory!
I had high hopes for the lasagna however it was a little too salty and lacked structure, I was going to say something to the waiter but we finished the lasagna nonetheless.
The Cozze was so delightful, the smokiness of the mussels, the flavors of the rich broth, the bread we already had on the table was the perfect match to help soak up the broth, in fact we liked it so much we ended up ordering more bread to go with the broth (we didn't order the grilled bread $3 to the Cozze because we already had bread on the table). Frankly, although we got this dish as an appetizer, I wouldn't mind eating it as an entree...
The Rigatoni... My only complaint is that I wish I had more! The rigatoni was cooked al dente and the Bolognese sauce was absolutely perfect for the rigatoni.
The Agnolotti was so cute and tasty. The rich flavors from the duck confit and roasted chestnut were the perfect pair with the sage and balsamic vinegar. The sage really brought out all of the flavors in ways I never imagined, this dish inspired me so much that I went to the store the next day to buy sage to try to make an interpretation of this very dish. Alas, I wasn't as successful and am totally okay with returning to Serafina for this dish!
The Laticello. Order it. Even if you don't have room. You won't regret it. I would come back to Serafina just for this cake in fact. Imagine a tiramisu but wayyyyyyyy better!!! The combination of the soft buttermilk cake, creamy coffee mousse and hints of the marsala, amaretto caramel, orange, pomegranate, and espresso tuile are spot on. It's a rich dessert with great flavors and the orange really brings it all together full circle.
Overall, great meal, will be back for lunch with my mom!"
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katie V.","Came here with my boyfriend for our 1 year and it could not have been more perfect. The ambience was nice and the pastas we ordered were delicious. Usually we can't finish them but the portion size was perfect. Can't wait to come back in the summer for the outside dining area!"
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Helen K.","Wow, wow, wow.
I think I would feel justified writing a billion wow's and calling it a review, because Serafina established, for me, an impeccably high standard for Italian cuisine. That said, if my billion wow's can't convince you to drop by this gem of a restaurant, please read on.
From the start, the service at Serafina was wonderful. My boyfriend and I made reservations that night, and we did not experience any waits as a result. The hostess kindly took our coats without my having to ask, and the waitress was attentive to our dining experience from start to finish, describing dishes in detail with excitement and patience for the many questions we had (my boyfriend and I are both on the curious side LOL). Shoutout to Beth, who was the best waitress ever!
With regards to the food, we began with the pane. The olive oil dip was unique, sprinkled with what seemed like red pepper flakes that added a delightful kick for each bite of the bread. For the mains, my boyfriend ordered the agnello, and I ordered the melanzane, both of which were phenomenal. The agnello was perfectly tender, pairing perfectly with the polenta. The melanzane, Serafina's version of eggplant parmesan, took me back to Rome with one bite. The portions for both dishes were also incredibly generous, and my boyfriend (who calls himself the ""bottomless pit"") had a difficult time finishing.
My only qualm about Serafina is the extremely difficult parking. The only option is limited street parking, which was frustrating even for me, an L.A. transplant. That said, the parking situation is worth it.
For me, really good food doesn't just satisfy your stomach or tastebuds but touches some part of you that isn't merely physical. Call me dramatic, but there are foods out there that we call ""soul food"" for that reason! Serafina serves up food belonging to that class, and I'm happy to say that I'll be coming back for more."

The wines and menu selections are varied and the food itself is absolutely delicious. This is the restaurant we choose for celebrating special occasions and Seattle family get-togethers. I will keep returning for the cuisine in the beautiful setting of this restaurant."
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","Came here on a sunny Saturday afternoon. While the whole restaurant was full, we got great service at the bar! Drinks were delicious (loved my midnight negroni) and food came quickly. Bartender made great recommendations! They were both great but the eggplant dish (Melanzane) may have been my favorite eggplant of all time. We will be back for a more formal dinner sometime! It was such a lovely large space with good natural light!"
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Torrie N.","I hadn't been to Serafina in YEARS, but remember having enjoyed it in the past, so was excited to check it out for Seattle Restaurant Week for lunch for the 2 courses. I went with some coworkers and we had made a reservation. Upon arriving, there were several tables available but for whatever reason, we were seated at a table in the corner, right against a half wall where it was super dark. Kind of weird, since usually when you make a reservation you get a decent/better table. We asked if we could move and they had no problem moving us to the table next to us. (No one sat at our original table so doesn't appear that they were saving it for another reservation).
As for the meal itself, I had the antipasti of the day which was a mushroom soup (cant remember the exact description since it wasn't printed on the menu). It was creamy, flavorful and pretty tasty! For the main dish, 3 out of 4 of us got the pasta which was Orechiette with peas and mushrooms (again, don't remember exact description) but it was VERY underwhelming. There wasn't much flavor at all, and no sauce really (just a little oil). The only saving grace was the Parmesan crisp on top (garnish) which added some flavor/saltiness that was much needed. Mushrooms were mentioned in the item description but there were literally 2 tiny pieces of mushroom on the pasta, but plenty of peas, which don't add THAT much flavor or depth (see pic). Hmm.. the rest was just the pasta. I can't emphasize how little flavor there was. Usually I'm sensitive to salt and tend to think things are over-seasoned. In this case, it was really quite the opposite - no complexity to the dish at all. Our other friend who opted for the meatballs commented that the meatballs were a little dry. I don't think she meant the meatballs themselves, but there was minimal sauce on top of the meatballs so the sauce was gone way before the meatballs were... it seemed like a stingy serving of the sauce.
The service was decent and everything else was fine, but I just can't get over how subpar the pasta was... I hope that this was just a fluke with this particular SRW dish, but for $20 for lunch, you'd expect to really have a tasty, enjoyable meal. I may give them another try but this place is definitely not a high priority."
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenna K.","Came here for Seattle Restaurant Week! Overall, I had a very pleasant experience - phenomenal food, good service, classic atmosphere. I got the three course for $35, and ordered the seafood soup as an appetizer, pork tenderloin as an entree, and the chocolate cake for dessert.
Both the soup and pork were delicious and very well seasoned. The soup has a spicy kick and a lot of texture that made the dish very fun. The pork tenderloin has this sweet, acidic sauce that balanced out the heaviness of the meat. I would highly recommend them!
However, the chocolate cake was a little bit underwhelming. I don't know if they make it in house, but it wasn't as great nor as creative as the other two dishes. If you are not coming here for SRW, I would recommend getting dessert somewhere else.
Service was overall pretty pleasant, but there were some caveats. First, the bread is $5 - although it's delicious bread, and I would highly recommend getting it, they don't inform you that it's an extra charge. There is also an additional 3% automatic ""service charge"" that is distributed to the kitchen staff. Once again, it would have been great if they noted it on the menu beforehand or something.
Regardless of the small caveats, I would definitely come here again, and would recommend it to other people. The food was great and had a very pleasant time there."

I had a fantastic experience the other evening, in the crazy snowstorm, and will definitely be back (and was smiling at how many other people braved the snow to stop by and enjoy your food and ambiance).
My dirty grey goose martini - was perfect! (And I'm really judgey about my martinis!) The wine we had was perfect with our meals. And my pasta - seriously, decadent, heavenly, and just what I needed."
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sasa S.","Delicious food! Even the oil that you dip the bread in was to die for. I tried the gnocchi with goat cheese (yum) and the duck confit pasta (omg yes, but tiny portion for a full size......) and the arancini (good but not standout), and the Limone salad (yes). The rest of the food my table ordered that I didn't get a chance to try was also raved about by all. I was sad they didn't offer tiramisu but their cheesecake did not disappoint. The waiter wasn't particularly friendly or available but we made do. Overall a wonderful experience, mostly due to the quality of the food at a not-overly-expensive price."

Rigatoni Bolognese is wonderfully delicious and a healthy portion.The saltiness of pecorino cheese balanced the rich sauce, lamb & fennel sausage. One of the best meals that was quite memorable. It has been almost a decade since I have been here. New ownership, still incredible as before. A great establishment for any occasion.
I will definitely be back more often."
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","R S.","We tried the place during SRW and tried the prix fixe menu. It was OK, not great. Tables are way to close to each other, the guy with the loud voice dominated the entire area with his talking. The food was redundant and bland and nothing special. The fresh fish was a salmon stew with tomato base, maybe someone would make that choice as a fresh fish, but not me.
Wines by the glass are very expensive for what they are, offering wines with long names from obsure winerys from other countries is deceiving to me, especally if they are cheap varietals being passed off as something special.
They poured a huge amount of sediment in one glass of ours, it was a terrible turn off and a sign the person who poured it did not know what they were doing or did not care if they served the dregs of the bottle to a customer. Who does that?
Service was OK, not great or bad."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cassidy G.","We've been twice now and absolutely love everything at Raccolto. Even with a reservation you may find yourself having to wait for a bit as it's a small space and they're always busy, but it's definitely worth the wait. Both times we've come we've ended up getting seats at the bar and having a cocktail while we wait for a table and the drink menu is always fresh, creative and delicious.
We got the steak tartare both times because it's that good; don't skip it, just order it and be happy.
This place does all fresh pastas and damn, they are delicious and noticeably better than anything you were planning on making at home instead. Could go on and on but just know this: everything we've had here is worth the cost, the wait, and more.
Finally, excellent service both trips in seal the deal. Our server last time in was so knowledgeable, friendly, nice to chat with and even comped our drinks for no apparent reason other than maybe because we had to wait a bit for our table. We love it here and will definitely be back again and again."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle D.","I'm a fan. The small shareable plates at Raccolto are excellent. I have literally enjoyed every single thing I have ever tried here. And that says a lot, because I don't like a lot. The cavatelli pasta ... yes, please. Always a must-have. The service is knowledgeable and warm without being intrusive. The location on California Ave in West Seattle has given our neighborhood it's first real contemporary Italian option. Helpful note before you go: The restaurant itself is small. There is a counter bar in the back I have sat at once, but otherwise always been seated in the main space and it's just not big and not cozy or warm. More like open and bright. Make a reservation on Open Table or call ahead. Most of the time you don't need to do that in WS, but here you should and you will get right in.
Now the negative. Despite liking the food and all, I'm giving them 3 stars for two reasons: 1) a couple years ago I wanted to have my office holiday dinner here. Tried to set it up way in advance. They were SUPER rude and dismissive. That alone kept me away for almost a year. 2) Came by once with friends when there were tons of tables open and they were weird and wouldn't seat us, saying they were booked. That's fine, but major attitude. We went and ate down the street and walked by to the cars two hours later and the same tables were open ... they didn't turn over. After these two incidents I almost never wanted to come back. But after some time I did. And it's good. I still won't be a regular given the above, but at one point I would have written a one star review (after someone was a massive jerk when all I wanted to do was spend thousands of dollars for a dinner party and rent out the whole place) and swore I would NEVER go back ... so the theme of this review should be ""forgiveness"" and a hard-earned three stars that is a testament to the great food."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bree S.","We came here a few months ago and it was 5 star perfection. The brussel sprouts, the burratta, the chicken. Amazing. This time was disappointing, but for the amazing pasta, which is worth the trip, despite the missteps.
There were serious timing issues that ruined the flow of the evening.
We made the mistake of going ahead and ordering food before drinks arrived. We waited over 20 minutes for drinks. Appetizers came before the drinks and were piled onto the table before the drinks even came. Then we waited an hour for the rest of the food.
The chicken was NOT the chicken we had the last time we were here. It was fatty and very salty. A lot of waste.
The cocktails were stirred in dirty shakers. There were multiple flavors in the drinks and when it was brought to the attention of staff, they were defensive and refused to mix a new drink, clinging to the claim that we didn't know what we were tasting. The waiter served the drinks with his fingers all over the rims of the glasses. He carried the drink in dispute back and forth from our table to the bar 3 times. No apologies or offers to mix a fresh drink in a clean shaker. It was awkward and instead of refusing the drink, we just relented. So disappointing. Instead of insisting on being right, why not just mix your clients a clean drink?
We loved this place when we came in October. Perfect timing. Very low key gracious service.
Don't know if it was an off night or if this is what to expect going forward.
Don't like to express disappointment in my own neighborhood, but for the premium prices we should expect premium service and quality of food.

"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Teresa J.","Finally made it here to celebrate my husband's birthday tonight and left feeling unsatisfied + I couldn't drink enough water to offset the amount of salt in our food.
We started off with bread and Brussel sprouts - the first bite was good but after that all we could taste was salt.
After waiting for awhile (and watching a larger group that came in well after us get their food before us) our two pasta dishes finally arrived with apologies for taking so long. The rigatoni was topped with pork and kale - I guess I didn't expect to see salty pork carnitas on top of a bed of over oiled/buttered noodles.
Pesto bucatini lacked flavor outside of the flick of the wrist of salt that was on every.single.thing.
Spent $100 (only one beer in the mix). Would have been fine if it was worth it, but so frustrating when it's not."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Janet N.","I dined here during restaurant week and did not have a good experience. I've had Raccolto bookmarked for awhile and was really excited to try the food. The restaurant is really nice and is aesthetically pleasing. However, I wasn't a fan of the fact that by the time I left the restaurant my clothes had reeked of their cooking.
The food was okay for the most part. I liked that the appetizers course had about 4 different plates to share at your table. I got to try a little bit of everything that they offered. My main was the halibut and it wasn't very memorable.. The plating was fairly sloppy. I can tell that they were rushing to make my plate.
The service was not good. Our server was initially pleasant, but I noticed a shift in her attitude and pace after I declined to opt into the wine pairings. A couple who also shared the same server as us arrived later than we did and received their appetizers and mains before we did.. We found that odd as everyone in the restaurant that day was essentially receiving the same meal. I just wasn't understanding her logic in serving people who came in about 10 minutes after we did? She never checked in on us and never refilled our water even after we had put the bottle on the edge of the table. Our plates of food were just being plopped on the table and she would vanish to cater to someone else's needs. I'm not sure if it's something we did, but we found the service to be unacceptable.
I think it's pretty obvious that I would never choose to dine here again."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristin P.","One of my favorite pasta places in Seattle! The service was awesome and the food was amazing! The ambiance is perfect for date night."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Monica D.","This is currently my favorite restaurant in West Seattle. It is wise to make a reservation but you can get a spot to eat at the bar if you go early.
The carrot soup is amazing and so is the smoked fish piled high on dense chewy grilled bread.
The pastas are always delish and we usually get a seafood recently copper river and the halibut is also great.
The food and wine have been so good in 8-10 visits I have never yet had dessert!"
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David B.","Hits the spot. Well thought out menu.
Nice staff for the most part. There are a few supercilious members who are confusing West Seattle with the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but the food makes up for it.
5 visits and most everything has been excellent. The pasta is wonderful, the cuts of beef nice and the greens are great.
I don't agree with the Orca-sized chunks for the Crudo. Personal taste, but it is about experiencing the fish and the flavors and not the choke.
Good to have a place for a ""little"" upscale swing on the Island."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Claire S.","We went there last night. I found the staff to be very nice and super efficient. At least the ones I met.
We each ordered pasta dishes, as well as coffee, wine, bread and a nice corn dish.
The problem was the pasta- their specialty. My husband ordered tagliatelle with crab meat. The pasta was cool to the touch; not even lukewarm. The crab meat in it was cold. Not cool- cold. The server couldn't have been nicer. She took the tagliatelle off the bill and comped our Americanos, which I appreciate.
Mine was barely warm enough so I went ahead and had it. Flavors were excellent, good sized portion. However, it sat uneasily in my stomach for a very long time afterward.
This is a gorgeous charming expensive place. They need to get their kitchen in order. Don't worry about seeing us again, because you won't."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","T O.","I've been eyeing this place for awhile and finally got the opportunity to go here this evening with family. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, clean and simple. Here is the run down of the experience:
Appetizers: Down right the best part of the meal. Loved the flavor profile of each of these dishes and I would have been content with just eating this alone.
1) Burrata with olive tapenade and crostini's.
2) Charcuterie - Salami, watercress and a sweet whole grain mustard with crostini's as well.
Pasta: Unfortunately, the pasta had a lot left to be desired.
1) Rigatoni - Braised pork, kale and parmesan. Was really bland and watery.
2) Bucatini - Pesto, tomato and parmesan. Was really bland and watery as well.
3) Strozzapreti - Bolognese and parmesan. Was the best tasting pasta dish of the evening, but lacked a good punch in flavor.
Drinks: We ordered a black manhattan and shared between us. Loved the flavor profile of this drink.
Service: The gals working tonight were attentive and very nice. Unfortunately, our main sever for the evening needs to not assume things. He was really trying hard to make the sales pitch to my family elders and pretty much focused on them. Seriously, treat us all equally, instead of sucking up to the people you assumed were going to be paying the bill. The look on his face when he realized he screwed up when I gave him my credit card to pay the bill was picture worthy. Also, we indicated that this was our first time at this restaurant and I stated I'm a regular at GH Pasta Co, but he spoke to me in minimal words that this place is not the same and much more upscale. Ummm... ok. There was no need for that pretentious vibe.
Overall, I say stick to eating the appetizers and having a drink here. If you want pasta, seriously go to GH Pasta Co. in downtown Seattle. Owned by the same chef and the pastas are fabulous! I'm hungry just thinking of the super flavorful pasta dishes one can get there.
Note - The bar is small and if you want a table you'll need to have a reservation. If you don't have a reservation, look on their online reservation service for availability as there actually might be a table available sooner then what the hostess will indicate to you in person."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kurt H.","After living in San Francisco and having dined at world class Italian restaurants and around the world, was looking forward to dining here.
To those who say ""this is the best Italian restaurant they've ever been to"", I say you must be a Seattle native. Salt is the prominent taste in every dish.
The steak was fatty, the Halibut was bland. Having to pay for bread and olive oil? How déclassé. Service was good, wine selection mediocre. We brought our own bottle of Napa Howell Mountain Cab. The waitress gave us white wine glasses (right) and never poured one glass for us, even though we paid the corkage fee.
The ambiance is dated by about 2 decades and don't expect to have an intimate conversation because you will hear everyone else's drown out yours.
Go to the Pink Door if you want a fine dining Italian experience with a stellar wine list and seasoned staff.
Thank you, Next."

We were all first-timers to Raccolto, so we asked for recommendations from our (excellent) server. The menu is all small plates, and you order and share. What a great way to have a meal! Everything we had was good. I liked some things more than others ... but the roasted chicken and strozzapreti pasta were absolute stand-outs. Very nice selection of wines, too.
This little gem is about a 15-minute Uber from downtown Seattle, and it's very much worth the trip. Definitely make a reservation. You won't be sorry!"

Only real criticism is that the interior is way too ""live"", and thus it can get quite noisy."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christopher N.","Last night I made spaghetti, and meatballs. The meatballs were handmade, and not to big up myself (#prayerhandemoji), they were on point. The sauce, and pasta were store bought though. I'm not going to shit on Paul Newman (RIP), so his sauce gets a pass. However, the pasta is always the weakest link. There's such a wide gap between dried store bought pasta, and fresh. Its almost like eating two different things, or equivalent to listening to mumble rap, and Gang Starr (RIP Guru). There's really no comparison!
I've been to Raccolto half a dozen times over the years, and its always been superb. From the appetizers, pasta, and proteins, its all done extremely well. The restaurant is also fairly beautiful. Clean, modern, and cozy. Also, the service is top notch, and thoughtful. The staff knows the food well, they give great recommendations, and are overall fantastic.
Tip: They recommend a starter, pasta, and protein. Every time before the last time i went last week I've only gotten a starter, and pasta. The server, who was great, recommended the aforementioned, and also a protein. Like a sucker, I got upsold. It was a lot of food, and after the starter, and pasta I was full, and didn't really have any room for the tasty protein. Go light people. You can always order more if needed. You're welcome.
My favorite two dishes are the Foie Gras Mousse, and Bucatini. I'm a foie gras junky, and order it at any restaurant that has it, or a variant. Raccolta's version is a creamy, rich mousse on bread with a jam of sorts. I'm not smart, but I'd call it honey. Three pieces come with an order, but I can usually only eat one cause its almost too much good. Its a must have if its your initial visit. Although all their pasta's are excellent, I'm partial to the bucatini w/mussels. The pasta is chewy, and cooked perfectly. I've had all their pasta dishes, and haven't been disappointed once, so order with impunity.
Tip 2: Make reservations or you won't get in unless you go in early enough. First time I went it was like 5pm (hey, I'm old, and although I'm not quite a grey hair yet, I like to practice their ways) and I got in. Subsequent times I've made reservations per their request.
I gotta get out to this joint more often cause there's no substitute for fresh pasta. From the food to the service, everything is top notch at Raccolto. The only thing holding me back is the jaunt to get to West Seattle from Burien, and I'll spare you the rant I'm sure ya'll are tired of. You're welcome, and Salute!"

It was my first time visiting and I was excited to see what the hype was about. The atmosphere was great, perfect for a large party or an intimate date night. The vibe was industrial chic in a loft setup, very open and welcoming. The cocktails and appetizers were delicious and came out fairly quickly. For my main course, I ordered the tagliatelle with crab, and I have to say I was very disappointed. All I could taste was butter. It had absolutely no flavor at all, and very little crab for an additional $8. Luckily, I tried my boyfriends meal which was the chicken rigatoni, and my sisters which was the halibut and both were flavorful and much better than mine.

We had a mostly great dinner here tonight which included some well made old fashions from the bar, gnocchi, bucatini, crab linguini, and a Sicilian pizza.
Added the spicy meatballs to the gnocchi dish and that was the best choice of the night because the gnocchi doesn't come with meat and those meatballs tasted perfect.
The pizza was a perfect blend of flavors and the crust was just crispy enough.
The bucatini cane with the smaller meatballs that were not spicy and the sauce was perfect.
The only bummer was the crab linguini which was too salty. Edible, but the crab especially was heavy on salt and it really took away from the flavor even though the sauce was tasty.
Will go back again and maybe the salt will have taken a chill pill. All in all.... recommend!"

Spaghetti with clams was outstanding
Substantial amount of crab for 13$ salad
Fried calamari was tasty w/ 2 sauces - one spicy, one tomato based
Grilled ck from kids meal was too charred and overcooked
Seafood pasta with tomato sauce was tasty
Kids penne pasta with meat sauce, butter and cheese was a overpowered with butter

"Mamma Melina Ristorante + Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamma-melina-ristorante-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gregory P.","""We should go to Mio Posto more often..."" is what my wife said to me as we left Mamma Melina tonight. That and ""we just won't ever go back.""
We have been coming to MM regularly together since 2012, and my wife has been going there since they were on Roosevelt long before that. Tonight was the last straw.
Perhaps they have changed management or been sold or something, but the food and the service have both degraded significantly over the last 18-months or so. The food was once good, and we left satisfied, and would take our leftovers home if there were any. Sadly our favorite dishes which we have ordered consistently are now rarely impressive and sometimes just bad. We often leave saying - wow that place has gone downhill. At least until tonight anyway.
The last time we were at the restaurant, we sat in the bar for happy hour and our waitress berated the bus boy so badly that we felt the need to pull him aside separately and give him a cash tip and tell him we thought he was doing just fine. She blamed the fact that no one had contacted us for 10+ mins on him and trash talked him to us after he gave us water.
Tonight we stopped in for dinner and were sat promptly, nobody contacted us for a solid 10 minutes, and when someone did, they apologized for the wait and took our drink orders. Another 15 mins later they brought our wine and took our dinner orders. Eventually when our food came out we had been sitting at the table for 5 mins shy of an hour and the food was warm (not hot) and my wife's bucatini was AWFUL. The meatballs were legitimately bad. My pizza was acceptable but was not cooked as well as I would have hoped, warm, but mostly undercooked. It took another 10 minutes of waiting before my wife went to the host stand to get our check.
It's unfortunate, but after having eaten there consistently for years, Mamma Melina will no longer be considered when we choose a restaurant to eat dinner or to recommend to friends."
"Mamma Melina Ristorante + Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamma-melina-ristorante-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alejandra V.","GREAT HAPPY HOUR!!! I'm almost nervous that I found such a great happy hour spot because this could definitely mean bad news for my wallet ;-)
Mamma Melina was recommended to me by an avid fan due to their amazing Happy Hour deals (all day Sunday & Monday, what?!) and their delicious Italian food. I have to say, she was right on all fronts, and I'm sold.
A few friends joined me for a celebration of my one-year anniversary of living in Seattle, and we definitely went all out with our menu choices!
We ordered:
- Gnochhi al gorgonzola
- Rigatoni al sugo di carne
- Ziti ai formaggi
- Parmigiania di melenzane (EVERYONE'S FAVORITE!)
- Formaggi italiani
- Margherita pizza
Everything was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. As mentioned, the favorite was most definitely the eggplant, as it was the most flavorful and just overall surprised all of us in its taste. I was also a huge fan of the gnocchi, which was recommended by others, as the dish had the perfect gnocchi texture and the creamy sauce was absolutely delicious.
Overall, for the amount of food that we ordered and our total bill, I'd say the quality and quantity of our meal was marvelous. We all left happy, full, and excited to come back soon for another Monday night Happy Hour!"

My girlfriends and I visited Mama Melina for the first time yesterday for dinner. Immediately I fell in love with the lovely ambiance and the interior designing here. Too bad the food and also the service was poorly executed. Im still confused to know who our main server was. It seemed like everytime someone came by, it was a different person.
Anyway, I arrived late compared to my friends and when I asked to see the beer menu, the waiter had no idea where it could be then said ""ill be right back"" moments passed by and still nothing... I had to ask for the beer menu 3 times before I got an answer. Finally when I ordered, it took 7 minutes for them to bring me my beer. Really?
Don't let the food presentation fool you. It may look great, but it was pretty boring and did not catch my attention. Could use more seasoning. Pretty restaurant, but not so pretty customer service and food."

The food: omg amazing! We popped in here for dinner and was honestly blown away! The food was exquisite! For appetizers we ordered two Caesar salads and a margarita pizza. Great salads! - the dressing was light and refreshing. The pizza was AMAZING! It's a Neapolitan style pizza (my fav!) and they truly made it right here. The margarita was a great one to get because it was fresh and bursting with flavor. For drinks we got the blueberry lemon rocks - SO GOOD (very refreshing!) and a glass of red wine. For the entrees we got a risotto ai gamberi - Phenomenal! Absolutely bursting with flavor! We also had the bucatini which was honestly to die for! We also ordered linguine with prawns as well as the pasta e fagioli. All the entrees were absolutely delicious! Truly an authentic upscale Italian restaurant. The prices were reasonable as well!
The atmosphere: a super cool and modern interior with a beautiful (DOG FRIENDLY!) patio! You can dress up or down. They have two spots in the restaurant which accommodate large parties.
The service was great and the food was even better!
Will I come back? YES YES YES"
"Mamma Melina Ristorante + Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamma-melina-ristorante-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mona M.","Wanting to get some super late dinner, we found Mamma Melina open until 11pm on Sunday! Plus when we got there, we were informed that it was happy hour until closing that night (and Saturday), so we went to sit at the bar area for the happy hour. The lighting here is quite dim giving an intimate/romantic ambience. The setup in the dining area was specially romantic with the classic chandelier and all. I really like the interior here.
The service wasn't the greatest which was apparent the moment we stepped in and not greeted with the slightest smile both from the hostess and the waitress. But I did find that she was quite attentive in checking on us.
We ordered Spaghetti al' ortolano which has grape tomatoes, pine nuts, big chunks of goat cheese and rucola. I don't usually care for goat cheese but this meal was enjoyable thoroughly specially with the crunch from the pine nuts as well, the flavor was very light though. We also ordered the Melina pizza which is the black truffle pizza with mushroom and mozzarella. This one is yum! The black truffle is very prominent. It reminded us with the NYC black truffle pizza that we had (that went viral before), minus the oozing egg.
For drink we got X-rated Tini (mango, passionfruit liqueur with sky blood orange soda) and Plum Blossom (pearl plum vodka, lemon juice and triple sec). Both drinks were very very good. The X-rated Tini is more a citrusy refreshing cocktail, while the Plum Blossom reminds me a lot of a cotton candy type of cocktail. I was pleased with the food and drink. Probably would order their eggplant parmigiana and their risotto next time. For dessert, we were hoping to order their cannoli but the waitress told us that they hadn't made it in a long time so we got their Tiramisu. The tiramisu sadly is pretty standard. Our bill came to about $60 excluding tax. Overall, for the portion and quality, I do find the price to be overpriced. However for a quick bite late dinner, we'd probably go back here again."

The food is good ( it was not my first time there) but the service was too slow - I know, it was mother's day but the restaurant was not so full to justify a 40 minutes waiting time to have our meal. The place is very modern with some touch of classic decoration. You can easily park in the public park at the back of the building. The restaurant is close to the Burke Gilman Bike trail just in case you are riding your bike and getting hungry. Our server - was very nice and polite. I will come back other time but not on mother's day.
My daughter had avocado toast and it was bland. She would not recommend it. I had the gnocchi and it was very tasty. My husband had the salmon linguini and it was ok. I got happy when he told me the food that I prepare was better. So, one star from my daughter, three stars from my husband and four stars from me. I still think that the waiting time had something to do with their reviews. And yes, we had reservations for mother's day!"

The vegan items I had were a salad and a penne and vegetable dish. The salad was typical, as was the penne and vegetables. The penne was more flavorful than some dishes I've had elsewhere, but not super flavorful, it was borderline bland.
The staff was helpful and friendly, making sure my order was on track while balancing feeding the rest of the group and making sure everyone was taken care of.
I probably wouldn't come here on my own but the service was great and the decor is really pretty. Definitely a good location for a semi-formal meal."

The hot fudge lava cake is mouth watering and the staff is so friendly. I always look forward to coming here and always leave so full!

I was not impressed by their website nor did the locale raise my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised when we entered the establishment by the infectious atmosphere we experienced. I pictured Vito's as a place The Godfather was filmed and I think he would have been proud to dine here. As luck would have it there was a great cover band playing which livened they dark ambiance. A few couples took to the small dance floor which was fun to watch. It was too loud for long conversations but we were quickly silenced by an array of deliciousness. I would definitely suggest the lasagna or the Farfalle Diavolo (if you like a little spice). Our favorite appetizer was the Gamberoni & Polenta.

I reserved a table in advance. Dinner was delicious and this review is about the SERVICE.....because it was SUBPAR. Our waitress, named Stephanie was unfriendly, lacked customer service skills or even normal people skills and just seemed to be annoyed or just didn't want to be there....
Our table is a friendly, happy group...not demanding or mean and we all have a lot of grace when it comes to others.
Her attitude made several of my guests uncomfortable and her lack of service was obvious to everyone because it was discussed later.
Our bill for our dinner was SUBSTANTIAL and we left a very gracious tip...even with the poor service, which honestly I should have reevaluated the amount we left.
I know that when I go out for a meal I want great service..that's why we go out...for the experience and I don't want to cook! I expect to feel good at the end of the meal on all accounts.
I did reach out to the management and finally received a reply, which was subpar as well...I'm disappointed and probably won't go back, which saddens me because it's an iconic Seattle place."

The table service was exceptional and the patrons we talked to were a treat. We had zero issues until we moved to the bar. Actually there were two bartenders; one was great, the other one was an ass. She was rude and loudly talking about a couple patrons that we saw to be very nice. I'm not sure if they didn't tip enough, or if they were just the wrong color? To be clear since we didn't catch her name, she was the bartender with the palest skin white sleeveless blouse and the most tattoos. Given the fact we had the best long weekend in Seattle that we could hope for, we had to overlook this person and her terrible attitude, or else she would have ruined our entire trip. I'm sincerely hoping her boss sends her to diversity and inclusion training , or else fires her and hopes she learns to be a better person in the future. Truly, this would be a 5 Star rating if we hadn't moved from our table to the bar. But witnessing this person's hateful attitude towards and older biracial couple literally turned our stomachs!"

Easily a one-stop spot for the whole night out- music started for us around 9:20pm and went on into the night, I think we left after midnight, hard to keep track of time but once you're inside it's easy to just let go and enjoy the space and people here. Thanks to the wait staff, kitchen wizards, fast bartenders and jazz musicians (The Michael Owcharuk Ensemble whose GOT rendition at the end was insane) that made our Friday so enjoyable.

That's amore.....When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling.
This was the song that was in my head the whole time during our visit to Vito's. I was excited that they offered live music and have 2 different varieties of musicians (1st one was Italian music focused and the other band that performed at 9pm was more New Orleans Jazz style).
It was a Saturday night we ventured out here, Note* we called to make reservations but they were booked however, the bar area is first come first serve so we took a shot and went anyways. If you want a table- make a reservation.
The venue is fairly small so I can see how the tables fill up fast. We sat at the bar, bonus they had happy hour until 7pm on a Saturday. Love my happy hour specials and even more when they offer it everyday of the week.
We ordered the following off the happy hour menu:
prosecco and red wine $ 5 each
Vito's Sliders (2)** they were delicious
We also ordered the Farfalle Diavolo $18
(sausage, prawns, spicy vodka cream sauce) I modified it to try to keep it clean as possible.
The ambience is what really made our visit unforgettable, the ""Italian band"" really sounded German to me but it was just a different old school vibe, I was digging it.

There's a private room in the back called The Cougar Room which can be booked for parties. The bartenders are knowledgeable and no nonsense. They always have vegetarian options. Last night I enjoyed the bruchetta, and a Caesar salad which was perfectly wilted - half a romaine head just the way I like it with a lemon wedge on the side. I sampled the main pasta dish without the tuna, which had some nice flavor profiles. They cycle through specials, so be sure to check what's available when you're there."

Let me say the Via Tribunali is a warm and cozy restaurant. Almost hard to spot from the street at night, it's got a low profile front entrance so I see it as really a restaurant more frequented by locals than perhaps maybe those of us from out of town. I was craving some local Italian food and did my research on Yelp and also checked out Open Table and decided to give Via Tribunali a try.
I dined alone that night and upon entering was greeted by a gal who was working behind the bar. I was hoping to sit at a table, but she quickly offered me a high top table in the bar area and since I was alone, I really didn't make a big deal of it but the barstool was a bit uncomfortable to sit at (honestly).
A male server came over to me with the menu and he seemed friendly (but did not catch his name - if he said it I missed it completely and it was not on my check when I paid (so can't relay that to you now in my review).
The menu had some very interesting selections, but I was really in the mood for some pasta and saw Rigatoni Bolognese (Giuseppe Cocco rigatoni giganti pasta, house made bolognese, grana padano - cheese) on the menu and that sounded really good! I gotta tell you this dish took me right back to Naples in Italy - authentic flavor and jumbo pasta cooked perfectly. The portion was just the right size too!
I was hoping to start with a soup or dinner side salad but neither option are on the menu, even though there were three salad options on the menu they all seemed to be entrée sized so I opted out. It would be nice for this restaurant to consider adding a small side salad or soup to their menu (as I bet they would be great) Also, no bread was served with the entrée which I found unusual for and Italian, so with a glass of the Villa Travignoli Chianti Rufina Toscana my meal was complete."

But whatever, I guess it's fine. Service in there just seemed slow.
I was excited for this pizza! It was sadly, underwhelming. It was extremely soft and floppu so everything slipped and slid right off. I think it was undercooked, idk.
It is a cute intimate vibe for a date night and there are a ton of pizza options. I'd be willing to give this place another shot in hopes of better service and less pizza flop."

The service was mediocre. I had to ask for everything by flagging whichever unfortunate soul was walking by.
The pizzas were nowhere near as good as I remembered. Do you notice all the black spots on the crust of the pizza? Basically, the crust is getting too burnt and the rest of the dough feels a little undercooked. My toppings were sliding off from trying to pick up a slice. I reviewed my old photos of the pizza here and it was not like this. They have changed both the crust and baking method for the worst.
I will look for a better Neopolitan pizza place we elsewhere."

I ordered the Negroni and old fashioned and both were strong and great.
BURRATA DI CAMPANIA ($16) - Oh man the mozzarella cheese was just amazing and went well with the roasted tomatoes. 4/5
POLPETTE AL POMODORO ($14) - These veal meatballs were delicious! There are only two pieces but they are huge. They are cooked in a nice sauce and topped with cheese. 5/5
MARGHERITA ($15) - Again, the cheese was amazing and just made this dish. There were only a couple of basil pieces on top which I was a little bummed about but it was still very good. They're cooked in a wood oven. I'd want to try one of their meat pizzas next. 4/5
TIRAMISU ($9) - I was full but still had room for dessert. It was light and moist and just perfect. 5/5
The service was great! I ordered an old fashioned which was amazing and slightly sweet, and when we ordered a second one the waiter said that they had a different type of whiskey and our next round was equally delicious but it was more smokey."

This was one of the only places open in the area during the snowstorm. I'm so happy it was because I had been wanting to try this place forever and it certainly lived up to (even exceeded??) my expectations. Such amazing pizza (comparable and even BETTER in many cases than pizza I've even had in ITALY!). The service was also amazing. Our server was really friendly and she even RUSHED OUT into the snow after we left to hand us our to-go box we had forgotten at the table. What a SAINT!
5 of us came in and got 3 pizzas + 1 calzone. We got two that were recommended by our server (Dante and Fratelli di Bufala) and then also the Salsiccia e Friarielli. All of them were made of the same amazing dough that was crispy on the outside and CHEWY on the inside. The tomato sauces were killer. So flavorful and just the right amounts of it. I liked all three pizzas we got, but I think my favorite was the Dante for those bursting tomatoes, prosciutto, and arugula. I loved them all though, I don't think you can go wrong with the pizza choice. The via tribunali calzone that we got was pretty good, but not a classic calzone that you'd think of -- it had a lot of spinach in it and had no sauce, only cheese. Still really good though! This is also one of those places that has you cut up the pizza yourself with scissors. I am all about that!
The space itself is cute and has a nice vibe with candles and nice music. I will absolutely be back!"

Arrived late night on a Saturday hoping to get some late night Happy Hour pizza and cheap wine. The restaurant was surprisingly empty. Which is weird because usually it's full. OK, count our blessings that we don't have to wait. Stood at the door for about 5 minutes, made eye contact with staff at the bar but no help. Notice sign says ""please wait to be seated"". Finally after waiting for around 5 min in that area (it's a long time if you really think about standing in an almost empty place on a busy night) we finally waved at the bar staff and asked if we could be seated or should we seat ourselves. She got the attention of the wait staff who was in plan sight but chatting with the cook who came over and finally seated us.
Fine. Whatever.
We sit down and ask for the Happy Hour menu. Ruh Roh. They don't do happy hour anymore.
Fine.
I'll order from the normal menu. It's been a while since we have been here anyways and I was craving some tasty pizza. We put in our order of two pizzas and clams. As we are waiting we realize that the waiter and the two cooks are pretty much chatting and playing around in the dining and kitchen area which is open to the dining area. It's not a big deal but it sure changes the atmosphere. What was once classy and posh ... Well it's not that anymore. Especially since one of the cooks (male) was wearing a white t shirt that was stained and didn't actually cover his belly. In contrast to the uniform outfits they used to wear.
OK fine. Nbd. Who cares.
It was only till I saw this dude chugging wine and making my pizza after rubbing his belly and only wiping his hand on a dirty rag did I really get irritated. This used to be a really nice date night spot for me and the bf..... Furthermore, our food took forever because (and I say this because I had nothing better to do but watch) the two cooks were messing around the entire time even yelling across the restaurant to the wait staff dude.
Yeah. I'm freaking sad but this place is absolute poop as of 2019 and I doubt I will ever go there again."

"Via Tribunali - Capitol Hill","https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-tribunali-capitol-hill-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Andrew S.","Saw the sign for VPN certification and was so excited! Unfortunately, this place has some kind of sewage/cleaning/I dunno what problem. It stunk to nine hells. No one should be allowed to sit in such a toxic environment.
Our sense of taste relies so much in our sense of smell that they are inseparable. Even if we could somehow stomach the overriding scent of sewage long enough to attempt to eat, I highly doubt we'd be able to even remotely attempt to enjoy what might otherwise be a good pie that deserves a fork and knife.
This place might be worth it. The tables that were in front of the wide open windows were reserved. Maybe those people know the secret that others may not, this could be secretly delicious. But holy shit, who would ever eat with the smell of raw sewage overpowering every other sense?"

We were working next door at Neumos and with downtime before the show we went on a ""hunt"" for the nearest clam pizza, which ended up being right next to us here at Via Tribunali; we glanced at the menu while smoking spliffs outside. We got our fancy clam pizza togo and ate it dirty style in a small underground greenroom. We inhaled it but i do remember everything about it being perfect: crust, sauce, cheese, & clams.
Sure the box it came in was mad problematic, but hilarious at the same time. I'm sure the boys in the greenroom after us got a kick out of it. I only wish they'd objectify men the same way and have a buff man with a substantial bulge protruding from his tight pants, holding a pie :)"

However I have to say the pizza's were not great. Good but not amazing. I wanted to love it but the first thing I noticed is that our two pizzas were not the same consistency. One was perfectly round and the toppings were relatively consistent across while the other was all weirdly misshapen with toppings erratically thrown around so that not all bites were equal. Some had toppings, others nothing. Even worse it looked like a child made it and for $18 that is just not right. I also don't care for the scissors to cut the pizza myself. I prefer it cut before being delivered especially considering its damn hot. Flavors were good but I just cant get over the one pizza (carbonara) being so poorly made. Also I am not a fan of chili infused olive oil. At least warn us my poor wife was dying. Service was good but not much was explained about anything such as the spicy olive oil vs the other on the table we didn't even realize was there. For the price, I would rather go to Tutta Bella. Great crust though. The place has potential but my first experience was a let down."

I didn't get a typical pizza/Italian food American-vibe. It was definitely very authentic.
Basically this place was so good I brought my mom when she flew into town and she was impressed (that's hard to do by the way). I definitely recommend coming here!!!

They have an extensive wine list with 8 or 9 wines you can get by the glass and the rest are all bottles. One thing to note is that at least for the red wine they serve it in a weird looking glass. The server proudly told us that its the same glasses that are used in Italy when we asked why we didn't get ""normal"" wine glasses lol.
We ordered 3 pizzas for 3 people because our server told us the pizzas are super thin. He was totally right... they were thin to the point where they provided scissors for you to cut through it if you wanted to.
I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza since I love mushrooms and salame on my pizza. You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients. The tomato sauce they use is not from canned tomatoes and gives a very light fresh burst of flavor that compliments the saltiness of the salami and prosciutto. The fresh mozzarella was not heavy at all as it can be with pizza that is overloaded with cheese (this was not). The crust was crispy and light. The pizza was so delicious, I love how it didn't put me into a food coma afterward. Btw, cut your pizza into small slices so your toppings dont slide off onto your face when you eat it :)
They also give you fresh grated parmesan and red chilli flake if you need it."

I would recommend the pies to be taken to the face immediately (I.e. in the restaurant or promptly right outside when getting takeout) as the key to its delicious nature comes from eating it fresh.
This is authentic pizza: not some overly greasy, obnoxiously cheesy with fructose-ridden sauce. Don't fall victim to the (few) negative reviews and envelop yourself in pizza paradise!"

My girlfriend and I walked here the other day, and we were both surprised about how delicious the food was!!! We had one of the linguine dishes with meatballs, which were just perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, moist and delicious. We also had the ravioli, also very well done and the seasoning and sauce were well balanced to allow the homemade pasta to shine, but still give the right texture and complete the flavor of the dish!
The only Con to this place is the 25$ Corking fee!!!!! OOFF! That one hurts, so in the future we will not be drinking when we come here, but the food has allowed me to keep this place at a 5 star review despite the ridiculous corkage fee.

The staff was super friendly and observant. Food arrived promptly. No problems with front of house service.
My order: Insalata Cesare, Fettuccine con Salsiccia, and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for my meal and then tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert.
The highlights of the evening for me were the wine, tiramisu and cappuccino. The tiramisu was lighter than I expected (perhaps more whipped cream or whipped egg whites to zabaglione and marscapone than normal) but the flavors were SPOT on. Seems from the other yelp reviews that the dessert are on point, so props to whoever is making those.
The salad was ok; not bad but also not super memorable.
The pasta was the real challenge for me. I enjoyed the sausage and the general flavor profile; however, the pasta was extremely stodgy. Some pieces of pasta were cooked differently than others and not all of it was even fettuccine (I think some linguine snuck in there). Overall the cook was way off to the point that I just ate the meat and a few bites and openly welcomed the arrival of dessert.
All in all, if I was in the neighborhood, I might stop by for some wine, tiramisu, and coffee and there is a slight chance I might try a different type of pasta, but this is not a place I would take my family to or go out of my way to return to."

The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is a hidden gem in the neighborhood. If you're in Magnolia for dinner - this is the place to be. I always order the Ravioli Marsala, it just melts in your mouth with each bite. I've also had the gnocchi and it's AMAZING! You just can't go wrong!"

This chicken is so parched, you'll feel like you're lost in the Sahara with each bite. This virtual experience can be yours too for only $25 pr plate.
I was excited to try something new and the reviews here looked great--So, I figured I'd give this place a try. I've been craving gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken ever since I ordered it from Brunello Ristorante Italiano a few months ago and was complete wrecked by its deliciousness. But, my meal at Mondello was unfortunately disappointing. The gnocchi itself was not bad. However the gorgonzola sauce lacked flavor and the chicken was offensive. There's no way that someone who cares about what they do and the people they serve, would served anyone the chicken that came on my gnocchi. It was literally hard as a rock. It looked like a chicken topping from a dominos pizza delivery would look like after sitting in your fridge for three weeks. I don't understand why some restaurants send out shitty food via delivery. This is not entirely uncommon, though I cannot say it's a regular pattern at Mondello, as I haven't ordered from them but this one time. So many people order delivery these days, you would think restaurants would recognize that kill'n the delivery game would bring in loads of new customers. Unfortunately, the message Mondello sent me with my delivery, was that they don't care about their delivery customers or the quality of food they provide to them. I am not sure their food is better in house, but, I for sure wont be fooled into spending nearly $30 on a single entree of this quality from Mondello ever again."

They listed their lasagna as their signature dish. I had a business meeting coming up in the Magnolia area so I made it a point to my coworker to make a stop here for lunch.
The decor is old school, almost stereotypical, Sicilian. I got their iconic lasagna while my coworker got the gnocci al gorgonzla. The lasagna wasn't just cut out of a pan and plopped down in an unappetizing square as I expected. It almost looked like it was individually baked to order (of course I know it wasn't) and then dressed with a delicious sauce. The pasta was very soft but not soggy at all. I can see why this dish is so famous now."
"Mondello Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mondello-ristorante-italiano-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Amy G.","My husband and I have been loyal customers of Mondello for years because it was the homey spot for good Italian food in our neighborhood. We were able to look past their fairly regular service blunders and mishaps, and the fact that the red wine was always served at 85+ degrees because we still felt welcomed and the food was plentiful and the quality was high.
But, after eating at Mondello a week ago, they have lost us. The family has faced the very sad loss of their matriarch, and the eyes on this restaurant now have a very different arrogance and focus on cutbacks for their own benefit. The place now feels like another manipulative Seattle restaurant taking sneaky steps to give you less for the same cost which will backfire as the experience and food quality has massively suffered.
We were made to wait for 10 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. A pack 'em mentality. Newly implemented, bread is rationed at one piece per customer and refilled for a charge. Red wine is still served too hot, yet the price per glass probably exceeds the value of the whole bottle. Portion sizes have shrunk, now 5 ravioli where there used to be 6 and they taste nothing like they used to. Veal has been replaced with bread in the no-meatballs. I mean, come on! Isn't that like the oldest trick in the book?
It is so disappointing to see how greed has messed with was used to a pretty good thing."
"Mondello Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mondello-ristorante-italiano-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Kati P.","Well....the service was very good. The homemade bread was unusual and very yummy.
The menu was very NON-CONDUCIVE for vegetarians. There were only two items on the entree menu and both were cheese-based. It's 2019 folks......there should be MANY choices for vegans and vegetarians.
The establishment was kind enough to make both of us a simple pasta dish with lots of veggies. We both asked for marinara sauce and our dishes came without any sauce, but rather in a clear 'soup'. We asked for sauce and a very watery and flavorless sauce arrived.
Both desserts we wanted were out, which was very sad. Why are they on the menu, if they're not available?
The biggest shock was the bill. We were charged the same price for our veggie pastas as dishes with meat or fish. Who charges $52 for two simple pasta dishes with no animal protein? Ridiculous.
We will not be dining there again. We have Italian restaurants much closer to home with rich red sauce and prices that are reasonable.

As mentioned from other write-ups, it is one of those underrated, flying under the radar established restaurants. It was time to update my previous posts from 5/18/14 and 3/15/15.
Earlier this afternoon (11/26/17) I headed back to Seattle via Bainbridge Island ferry, texted family members to ask where a family member's birthday was to be celebrated. Coincidentally, Mondello came up while texting.
We all decided to meet up in Magnolia Village at a nearby indie café since Mondello didn't open until 5pm on Sundays. We showed up a few minutes shortly after opening, warmly greeted, and seated at the same 4 top coincidentally from previous visits.
The restaurant's matriarch, Enza, wasn't perched at her usual counter seat. But instead, we had Corino Bonjrada, Mondello's owner, do the personable meet and greet as we perused our menus.
Beverages:
glass of Rosso della Casa ($9), Orange San Pellegrino soda ($3.50, with refill), and plentiful ice water.
Starters included:
Warm slices of house bread with herby dipping olive oil.
Antipasto Misto ($16) which had cured prosciutto and Parma (?) ham, cheese drizzled with balsamic vinegar, but no olives present on the serving board.
Bresaola ($14) which was one giant slice of cured Painted Hills beef. I ended up poaching both the arugula with grated parmesan and the greens from the antipasto plate, this made for a tasty mini salad.
Zuppa di Lenticchie ($12) with flavorful lentils, homemade sausage served in a generous bowl.
(Note: This much delayed post continued on 1/28/18, over two months later. Checked and noted menu prices went up slightly compared to this November 2017 visit. Details now fuzzy and receipt faded, my apologies fellow Yelpers.)
Main entrees included:
Pesce del Giorno (market price, $35)
Ravioli Marsala ($18)
Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18)
Desserts included:
Tiramisu ($9) with an espresso ($3)
Limoncello ($9)
Affogato ($11, but comp'ed by the owner)
The celebration continued when two flutes of Moscato d'Asti was also brought to the table, gratis.
For a spontaneous birthday dinner decision, this was spectacular success! Thank you to
Corino Bonjrada and all of his restaurant staff.
Grazie mille!"

I've knew about Mondello from their sister restaurant way back when several years ago! Just never trek it up here before. I mean I know La vita e Bella! I like the food!! Not crazy in love!!
But I guess this isn't the same! First: love the beautiful colors! Brought my mom for lunch here, we usually only do italian for family meals. Duh!! :)
Love: the gorgeous grandma that runs the spot! She's elegant! Spoke italian!! Si grazie!! Feel so home!!
Lunch menu was simple: fed appetizers! Several pasta and paninis. Pasta are basically traditional Sicilian dishes the classic like polpettes, carbonara and puttanesca. Nothing crazy elaborate! Though our neighbor tables swear by the ravioli in Marsala sauce! We went with our usuals!
Pasta vongole for moi! Always!! Love the wine and garlic parsley explosion!
Puttanesca with rigatoni has a nice kick!!
Fettuccini polpettes was good too!
Best part of all of this that got me squealed?? Fresh pasta!!!! It was love at half a bite. Ain't nothing like fresh pasta!! This is not the hand rolled but still it was perfect!! Usually I have to travel to my family in Rome for this much fresh pasta!!! Oh happiness!!!
I didn't even need my sauce to be honest!! Love it! So happy!! Too bad they don't have happy hour!! Or smaller plate options so I can try them all! Till then, grazie tanti per bella pranzo!!"

This week I got to cross it off that list, thanks to the squid ink spaghetti with jumbo prawns dish I devoured at Mondello's.
Rustic and filled with the charm of an Italian villa, this restaurant hits the mark with its scratch-made pastas and cook-to-order entrees. The decor is Instagram-worthy and the vibe is like a big hug and kiss on both cheeks. While waiting a long wait for your food, you can expect a tableside visit by one of the owners and Mama Enza's homemade bread with garlic dipping oil.
I highly recommend the squid ink spaghetti, Mama Enza's lasagna and anything with seafood (their specialty). Mussels, specifically. Nothing is done in haste or on the cheap here, but if you can budget for it and aren't in a rush, you will walk away singing Bocelli."

A Big Rock found in the her seafood special by our guest. Spinaci soffritti had no detectable butter, lemon, garlic or salt & it seemed to be sautéed in a pan that was not hot enough with olive oil. Spinach should be Awesome in an Italian place like this. Mondello is not special or quite up to average in the Neighborhood Italian restaurant category. Were told they were out of bread After we talked about ordering a couple Mussel and Clam appetizers and After we ordered an $85 bottle of wine. Was told when I asked about a bread store, that a grocery store was across the school yard and had baguette. It was a Saturday night and a 8:pm seating, our guests hadn't arrived, I had time I walked to get baguette. The restaurant could of done this... the food was definitely Okay. The Canolli very good! The check included a 20% gratuity. Not cool as we were five plus one calm kid. Run and staffed by the cute Italian owner and her daughter(s). Not motivated or professionals. When the owner was showed the rock which was larger than a quail egg her response was ""no, no that's not a rock it's not possible to notice these in with the clams"" and after we ordered the Cozze & Vongole apps we we told they were out of Mussels.

The server took time to learn our wine interests and made recommendations, bringing out several for us to taste. We ordered our food and it arrived quickly. The menu is fairly traditional (meaning it's light on the meat options).
I ordered the risotto and WOW was it good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it....
Between the food, service, atmosphere, and good wine... I will surely be back."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek R.","I don't know what happened last night, but we'll never be back. Had an 8pm reservation. After being seated nothing happened. No one said a word to us. No quick hello. No drink order. No ""be right with you"". Sat there until 8:15, and this place isn't that big. I know 15 minutes doesn't sound like a long time but when you are just sitting there in a tiny room, believe me, it is. Started to get worried that no one around us had food. When I thought a server was finally coming to us she stopped at a table next to us that had been seated at least 30 minutes and asked if they were ready to order. Nope. We had a show to go to and this almost hijacked the whole evening. We left.
By the way, quick note, take this as you will. A young poorly dressed couple came in when we were waiting. Like, girl was wearing a Rugrats T-shirt. They looked scruffy but seemed like a nice couple looking for a date night. They asked if there was a table available and the girl said no, fully booked all night. Literally a minute later a better dressed older couple comes in, asks same question, gets told there's a 20 minute wait. My wife and I were like ""hmm, that just happened"". I imagine some might like they do this, protecting their otherwise nice ambiance, but watching it happen was off-putting to us."

Everything on the menu is goooood. We got sardine pasta and tonight's special scallop spicy tomato sauce linguini. AMAZING.
Then we had Panna cotta and tiramisu for dessert. Such a lovely place. Perfect for dates and important anniversaries."

The staff was so welcoming and friendly. They all went above and beyond for my boyfriend and I while we dined. Our server, Ray, was very kind and attentive. We were from out of town and he gave us great recommendations on what to order as well as other things to do around Seattle. The owner, Mario, served us our food as well as dessert. My boyfriend ordered Chicken Marsala with pasta and I ordered the Fettuccini Ai Funghi. Both dishes were incredible. We got a cannoli and tiramisu for dessert, and both were phenomenal. I can't recommend this restaurant enough! It is a must."

We came in on New Years eve, without a reservation. After waiting about 5 minutes, we were seated at a cozy table in the corner.
We started with the arugula salad and soup of the evening, which was a white squash soup..super tasty.
As our main entree, we ordered their two specials. One was lobster fettuccini and the other was Osso Bucco with risotto! OGM..both were outstanding!!
We brought our own bottle of wine, but each enjoyed a delicious glass of champagne while our wine was breathing:)
Our server was great. The only thing I didn't like was the complementary bread...not my style...but everything else was AWSOME!
Can't wait to return!"
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael N.","Great little hole in the wall. If you want a near Italy-like experience, eat outside. The tree canopy and surrounding apartment complexes add to the experience as if you're actually in Italy. The service was excellent. Waiters and owner herself checked on our table frequently to make sure the food and experience was high in quality to which it was. You must go for the black linguine and smoked salmon. One thing that prevents this place from being a perfect 10 for me is that the surrounding area is full of questionable people. One example was a man who was offering free blowjobs. But being a great little hole in the wall, it really takes you away from all that noise even if the free blowjobs were waiting for you outside.
Food: 9/10
Dining experience: 9/10
Overall: 9/10"
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer G.","My boyfriend and I went here during a short weekend trip to Seattle so I can't say of it's the best Italian restaurant in town, but I have a hard time imaging what they could do better. Our server, Ray, was attentive and friendly. He seemed to genuinely like his job and even took time to talk to us about Seattle and give us some tips on places to check out.
The restaurant is definitely a small hole in the wall but the decor is nice and the tables were cozy without being cramped.
We started with the calamari which is served in an amazing pesto sauce. I had their fettuccine ai funghi. If you like mushrooms I'd definitely recommend it. My boyfriend ordered the tortellini in a meat sauce. It was yummy and super unique."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Shannon L.","This place is the perfect romantic date spot, although, for my first visit, I took my children. It has been open for 25 years. They have a piano player on Saturday nights who has been playing there for all 25 years. Apparently, the menu hasn't changed, either. I had mushroom risotto, which was delicious, and my daughter had cheese ravioli, also delicious. My son said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had in all 8 years of his life."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ben C.","Note: I would say the restaurant is more of $$$ than $$ as your price per entree will likely be over $30 a person if you're going for the more decent dishes but not surprising as it seems like the spot is made for ambiance.
We got the bruschetta to start and two glasses of red wine. The bruschetta had a bit too much garlic and wasn't easy to eat as the bread is tough. Flavor-wise it wasn't bad but I don't know if strong garlic breath is what I wanted after this dinner.
For main entrees, we got the Risotto ai Funghi and a squid ink pasta topped with calamari and a few prawns. The risotto was the most expensive bowl of rice I have eaten. I did enjoy the flavor of the risotto though and it definitely is rich. However, I don't think it looked great so... presentation was a bit lacking. The squid ink pasta itself was mediocre at best. ""Meh"" was my thought after taking a few bites.
I did like the fact that they brought out a tray and explained the desserts before we decided on one. The tiramisu was a bit overly sweet and lacked more coffee notes.
Towards the end, I could see many tables start to leave while we did not get the check. We finished around 9 PM and stood up around 10 PM to walk up to the counter. It was only then that the wait staff asked us if we were ready to check out. Places like pho restaurants do that because service is not really a thing there. For a restaurant of this caliber, that can be pretty unacceptable and it made me uncomfortable as I did not want to flag someone down.
Overall not very impressed with the food portions or quality. Even though the spot was cute, my partner and I don't think we'd come back unfortunately as we've had much better for a more reasonable price in the area and more attentive service."

Family of four and every dish was incredible; even the plain old cheese ravioli - has a perfect sauce that takes it to the next level. Not a white table cloth, upscale place but that makes it feel better; like Itialy, you feel
loke you could get a bottle of vino and just eat for 45 mins on the amazing food while chatting with friends (or strangers at the next table). Wine pours were very generous and while it wasn't a typical name brand wine list the wines were very good. Outdoor seating wasn't available but I could envision amazing ambience if it were. Wait staff was very helpful with my teenagers that asked lots of questions, I felt like they wanted you to have a great experience.
Will be back for sure."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennie L.","On a rainy day in Seattle, my husband and I who are Canadian stumbled onto this place. We actually only picked it because it was quasi close to our hotel and we didn't want to be stumbling around in the dark, in the rain. We were glad we did. Really sweet and romantic place. Charming, with a intimate setting for a date night. Loved the chandelier. Our server was kind and quick, answering our questions about the menu and giving suggestions. Really great server. I decided on the home made linguini with smoked salmon in a lemon cream sauce. My husband ordered the spicy sausage penne with a tomato based sauce. I also ordered a glass of wine. I have to say, with the low prices to high quality wine in the stores, I was disappointed with the price per glass of wine. And no half liter house wine specials. This should be a given in a Italian restaurant. Prices were slightly high but in the acceptable range of what we were generally eating in Seattle. Definitely my pasta was the winner. Delicious springy noodles in a rich creamy lemony sauce with generous portions of salmon. My husbands pasta was pleasant enough and generous enough, but the home made noodles made my dish shine. Definitely worth a check if you are wanting a romantic date night."

"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yoona K.","Had high hopes because almost everything we tried in Seattle was good, but La Fontana Siciliana was just standard Italian for my liking. The outside area was super cute/beautiful for date night. They have tables surrounding a pretty fountain right next to the entrance of the restaurant. The interior is also very intimate and tiny. My seat was pretty uncomfortable because I was so close to the table behind me...
The food was good but nothing stood out where I wanted to come back. We ordered the Fettuccine ai Funghi and the Fettuccine del Bosco. The serving size was also pretty small compared to most other Italian places I've been to. Normally I will have to always take at least half of my pasta dish to go but this place made me feel like I needed to order more after my meal... The service was pretty slow and the waiter barely checked up on us. Food 3/5, Service 3/5. There seems to be a lot of other Italian places nearby. If you are visting Seattle like I was, I would recommend going to try somewhere else."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Geana N.","My husband and I brought my cousin who's visiting from out of town.
The restaurant is super intimate and radiates a rustic, authentic Italian restaurant. The space is small and the decor is of neutral stucco, with purposeful cracks in the walls that added to the old world Italy feel.
They have a piano, and at the the time we were there, they had a pianist playing. This is a very romantic space. You would not know this restaurant is located in Belltown because it's hidden behind tall gates where It appears that there is only a water feature. The restaurant is off to the side within the little courtyard.
We did enjoy the food. But it wasn't so super delicious that I will crave the meal again. Service was slow and unconventional particularly with the wine. They opened a bottle and put it on the table without asking anyone to taste it first. They didn't keep our water glasses refilled so we shared our water.
3 stars for the lovely atmosphere, good meal, slow and not up to par service staff for this type of restaurant."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Scott D.","In the pantheon of Italian restaurants in Seattle, this gem, just a stone's throw from Pike Place Market, is often overlooked and under-rated.
La Fontana Siciliana is a great example of understated elegance, from cooking to serving to the atmosphere of the place itself. Here you'll find true Old World Italian cuisine served by an impeccable waitstaff in a place with warm ambiance that is both comforting and elevating at the same time.
Pasta dishes are excellent, as are their entrees. Some highlights: Fettucine ai Funghi, Fettucini del Bosco, Pasta con le Sarde, and Pollo Marsala. Their risottos are also excellent.
La Fontana Siciliana is ideal for romantic casual dining, spending quality time with good friends, or before/after a concert or movie close by. Highly recommended for the cuisine, the service, and the atmosphere."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Hope H.","Incredible experience. It seems this is one of the only more traditional Italian restaurants in downtown Seattle, which as a visitor without a car, I didn't want to go outside downtown. The atmosphere was romantic and wonderful. It's a small little restaurant so I'd imagine you'll need a reservation on a Friday and Saturday night. We had the soup of the day, a butternut squash bisque, and the garlic bread to start. The soup was to die for and was topped off with a great parmesan cheese and olive oil. Wonderful pairings. The garlic bread was delicious and great for dipping into the soup. We ordered veal and two pastas for our entrees and not a single plate had anything left on it after. Highly recommend the veal cannelloni which was the star of the night. Portions are of good size, so good that we couldn't even consider desert as we were full with delicious italian carbs."

"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lawrence P.","Superlative experience, from the hostess, wait staff and food.
My girlfriend friend and I are pretty and snobby about our Italian food (being from the NY area). This place does not need to be graded on a curve.
We shared the arugula salad, suppli, burata, and clams. Maybe one dish too many but would not have been able to skip any of them in retrospect. And to make my gluttony worse, I could not get the ""polenta cake with gold pear"" from the dessert board off of my mind...so I indulged. I rarely order dessert but am so happy I did...tears of joy well up remembering it.
Well-seasoned food - rich where called for, appropriately spiced, etc.
ThIs was our thIrd or fourth time visiting. Always solid (hence the return trips) but this night was absolutely next level."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Candace H.","Bar Del Corso is a hidden gem of Beacon Hill! I can't believe I've driven past this place a bajillion times over 10 year and yet I have not once tried it until now. I came in on a Friday around 6:30pm for a casual date night - we only waited about 5 minutes till we got seated. I was encouraged to find a decent amount of people waiting inside the restaurant! Their interior feels homey and it's bustling with energy. I did find the noise level louder than a normal restaurant, but I liked how energetic the atmosphere felt.
What to order:
-FUNGHI PIZZA: if you're a shroom lover like me, then you'll love this pizza! Mushrooms and sausage! It also comes with pizza scissors so you can cut the slice to the size of your desire. Its wood-fired pizza too. The only little let down was that some bits of the bottom of the pizza was a little burnt. But the flavor on top was still great so I still ate it!
-FRIED RISOTTO BALLS: its got a great crisp, yet piping hot interior with melty mozzarella cheese in the middle. A great small plate to go with your meal!
-ARUGULA PEAR BALSAMIC SALAD: the balance of flavors and textures in this salad was refreshing and delicious. Pears were sweet and the cheese and arugula paired so well with it.
-GRILLED OCTOPUS: so tender and it felt like a mix between italian and spanish flavors. The sauce is delicious so I would be sure to order a side of housemade bread to soak it all up!
We practically finished ALL this food except for half the pizza and the bill was under $55. What a bargain! Service was quick and the server who helped us was attentive and helpful in helping us make our choices. I will for sure come back to try the meatballs and dessert, and give the pizza another go :)"

We had the classic Margherita with a bottle of wine and finished it off with the most amazing, life altering dessert! It was this delicious combination of orange, chocolate and tiramisu! Yumm!!! Definitely a hit! The wait on a weekend can be long, so be ready to put your name down and take a walk around the neighborhood! The wait is definitely worth it!"
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Naveed N.","Love this place. Fun and friendly atmosphere with good service, food, and drinks to boot. Came on the recommendation of a friend, and have been back twice more for drinks and pizza.
My first experience at Bar Del Corso was April 2018- three of us stopping in for dinner around 7 PM on a weekday evening. The wait was about 10 minutes, and even more painless considering you can order a drink while you wait. I have yet to experience a wait more than 5-10 minutes, but 7/8 is generally also the earliest you'll catch me out for dinner.
Parking is easy on Beacon Ave or in any of the neighborhoods perpendicular. Inside the atmosphere is very much a casual neighborhood bar/cafe vibe, with an open kitchen concept, an open area of seating between wooden beams, as well as seating at the bar. I think this serves well for any occasion whether you're having a quick/casual drink, dinner, or a decent night out in the neighborhood.
The menu is seasonal and simple with a good selection of small plates, salads, cheese/meat, and excellent Neapolitan pizzas! Can't go wrong with their salads/veggies, the Burrata is a fantastic choice, as well as the grilled octopus.
The Pizza... yes. I'd venture to say the pizza here falls confidently in my top 2/3 favorites in Seattle. Perfectly thin and wood-fire charred, the right amount of sauce and cheese, with delicious toppings. The Funghi is a great choice. They also provide you with fun pizza cutting scissors to create your own sized slices.
As for the bar- they generally have a small but good selection of beers on tap, and great cocktails at a fair price. I've been more than happy with the Aperol Spritz and Negroni here.
All things considered, Bar Del Corso hits high on every cylinder. It is convenient to get to and park, wait times aren't crazy, boasts a fun and friendly atmosphere for any occasion, and then there's the pizza.. (insert heart-eyes emoji.) This is one of those reviews that it pains me to write because I don't want it to get more busy and popular but regardless I hope you'll give it a try. Cheers!"
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Srikanth T.","It gives me no pleasure to say this but Seattle may be one of if not the worst pizza cities in America. The dollar slice spots I've been to don't even know how to operate a business let alone make a decent pizza (seriously if your business closes at 2:30 don't run out of pizza at 1:45 and stop making pizza it's not that complicated). I didn't have high expectations going into Bar Del Corso and my expectations sank when I got there and there was a long wait. On the one hand maybe it's because the pizza was good on the other hand maybe it's because there are like 3 restaurants in Beacon Hill and this was one lol. Anyways when we finally got seated and got our food this place definitely blew me away. The risotto and cheese balls were a great appetizer (they only give 3 in a tray so if you're really hungry order 2 of them) and the pizza itself was exceptional. It's by my count the only Seattle pizza place that exceeds the extremely low bar of being better than a Dominoes (no seriously dominoes might be #2). We ordered the margherita pizza - added tip get the prosciutto on there and cook it, it has a nice crisp to it. There was also a sausage and peppers pizza we got that was also excellent. And as an added bonus the owner is really friendly and does talk to customers. Apparently Megan Rapinoe used to frequent this place and she's real chummy with her, which is kind of a fun fact you can tell your friends about if that's the sort of thing you're into (hey this pizza place I went to Megan rapinoe also went to a lot!). My only negative is the wait is kind of long, but well worth it given that this is the only pizza worth going out of your way to eat in a 300 mile radius (probably).
5 Star Sriview - Megan rapinoe eats here. You wouldn't want to be against her now would you?"
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Felicia N.","Loved this little gem tucked away in Beacon Hill. We stopped by on a Wednesday night after an afternoon at Alki and didn't have to wait.
The atmosphere is casual and feels like a bustling neighborhood hang out. They have some outdoor seating in the front and the back, perfect for Seattle summers.
We ordered the Salami pizza, Vongole alla marinara, and the Arugula and frisee salad.
Everything was delicious! The pizza was incredibly thin, perfect char, and amazing ingredients. The clams were made with fresh tomatoes and came with the perfect assortment of breads to soak up the yummy sauce in. We were impressed by the salad because we make a very similar one at home... but somehow theirs was ten times better! It was perfectly dressed and balanced and the ingredients were super fresh.
Can't wait to come back to this spot and hopefully get a table outside next time! I'm very happy to support this local business."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Monica S.","One of my favorite pizza spots in Seattle! I've been here multiple times and have always had a positive experience.
They always have quite the crowd and line out the door, but we always manage to get a table in 45 minutes or less. Their menu is very straightforward and the options are good, since I don't like having a million and one options. Service is always on point, and I really enjoy the overall ambiance of the place. One minor thing, was that some of the pizzas tasted burnt to me on our last visit, but I guess that's what you get with a wood fired oven.
With your pizzas, they give you scissors to cut your pizza, and cute containers of chili oil and chili flakes on the side.
I've tried multiple pizzas and other dishes here including:
Burrata and Rapini: yum! great appetizer option that had me feeling light, but still filled us up
Corno Di Capra: one of my favorite pizzas!! delicious!
Rapini: favorite of the veggie options, that is still super hearty
Salame Piccante: good flavor!!
We got a bottle of red as well, and it was recommended to by our server, and a great recommendation it was! Will definitely be coming back in the future!"

Ordered a glass of wine for myself and a cider for my spouse. The cider was good but it was the smallest glass of cider I've ever seen served in a restaurant! Re-orders from the bar were very slow to arrive.
The food was really good. Tried two different salads, the rice and mozz balls, a mushroom pizza and a strawberry rhubarb dessert. Loved the salads!
The prices were fair and the service good. Alas, the restaurant is so very loud when full of diners."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ken V.","First visit revealed a packed restaurant and the promise of a fairly lengthy wait. We decided to order takeout, and were surprised at how quickly the order was prepared while we waited. Three different versions of their pizza...each prepared very well and delicious. Three different salads offered the same results--good sourcing, delicious and balanced flavors.
It may not be fair to judge a ""sit down"" restaurant by the results of a takeout order...but they did a very good job. I look forward to my next visit being a little better planned, with an opportunity to more fully appreciate the restaurant and service."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christine V.","I came here with my girl friend for a weekend dinner around 7, and it was pretty packed when we got there. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations but you could tell the waitress that you don't mind sitting at the bar, which was what we did and it ended up being around a 40 min wait for us.
The menu consists of small plates to share, salads, some sliced meats, cheeses, and of course, the pizzas! There is not a huge selection of pizzas to choose from, but everything sounded amazing. We were starving and ended up ordering two to share - the funghi and the margherita. Both were so so good! The pizzas were thin, had the perfect char to them, and were not overloaded with ingredients to make them fancy. The simplicity is what really helped highlight the products they use. They also bring you a pair of scissors so you can cut the pizza yourself.
Highly recommend coming here for some good Neapolitan pizza! I can't wait to come back for some more and to try some of their smaller plates also."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jason P.","My favorite pizza place for Neapolitan style pizza, it has a great casual atmosphere, other great options beside the pizza all at a great price, if only it was open later in the night, but even with that complaint it still a five stars for me.
Bar Del Corso is just a little bit out side of downtown Seattle, on the main street of Beacon Hill, so there is free street parking available. The restaurant itself is nice and open with an interesting art on the walls. There is both bar and table seating, but can get packed in busy times.
The staff is great, they are vary laid back while still attentive. This is a very causal place to eat some great food with friends and it can get pretty loud in here.
The pizza style is Neapolitan, so it thin crust with a nice char on the bottom. There only 6 pizza options on the menu, with maybe a one or two more on the special of the night. All of the options are only a few ingredients so the pizza are fairly simple, but done really well and highlight those ingredients. Beside the pizza, there are various Italian small dishes and vegetables, and cured meats. Like the pizza, they are simple but done really well."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joop V.","Great option for a nice and a very well priced dinner in Seattle! My friend and I met up for dinner on a weekend and we ordered 4 dish: rapini (with poached egg), arugula and beets salad, grilled octopus and beans, and a Funghi (mushroom and sausage) pizza. We both enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the restaurant...it was a non pretentious classuc meal yet very casuso enough that you feel so comfortable hanging out there.
Our meal portion was good! Our of all the dish, I enjoyed the Rapini (fresh filling and still light and refreshing to eat with accompanied bread!) and the grilled octopus (great to have octopus once in a while for me...and I loved that they gave us plenty of bread to sop the sauce!) The most. The pizza was good too..it wasn't too oily and I loved the smell and the mix of mushroom and meat on it. The salad was ok..quite ordinary..but nothing wrong with it. I think I will skip next time to try something else. We ate a lot but yet still had some salad and pizza leftovers for the next day.
Overall, a great, busy very reasonably priced restaurant in Beacon Hill to check out!
P.S: go early when they open at 5pm! We showed up at 4:4 5pm and the line was already forming. By the time we left, there were so many people waiting for the tables! They don't take reservations...and if you don't show up around opening time, you will likely have to wait in a potentially long line for your seat!"
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kat V.","Have you ever complained that the food was too salty? Well you don't have to worry about that here! They don't even know what salt is here at BDC! I'd argue that they don't know what flavor is either, but that may be a bit harsh, plus I'm only 1 opinion.
We ordered the meatballs along with a margherita pizza and despite appearing delicious they were both MEH -- nothing special, almost bland! Very disappointing because I've never encountered such bland Italian food. I'll say though that the pizza crust was nice and thin and crisp, but the taste of charred crust was really all I tasted, and not because it was overpowering but because the sauce tasted like only a whisper of marinara.
There are much better Italian eateries around. Try Cascina Spinasse or Pizza Credo."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bryan K.","Bar Del Corso is a quintessential neighborhood gem of a restaurant. I've heard so many good things about Bar Del Corso, now I'm kicking myself for not trying it sooner. I came with a friend on a Friday night around 6 and it was packed. Despite all the people waiting for a table, the wait only about 15 minutes.
The menu is quite small, but packed with goodness. We got the Suppli a Telefono (risotto balls), Polpettine (meatballs), and Funghi pizza. Risotto balls were the bomb. Rice and cheese rolled into a ball and fried golden brown. These are the kind of balls you want in your mouth... Meatballs were also very good served in a rich marinara sauce with slices of bread. Finally, the pizza is awesome. The crust is impossibly thin, yet still has structure, bite and the right amount of char. This is some of the best pizza in Seattle. The pizza comes uncut, with a pair of scissors so you can cut your own slices. You can cut once and say you only had 2 slices. The total came to a little over $30 for 2 which is an absolute steal. They don't have Happy Hour, but with these prices it's basically always Happy Hour.
The restaurant has the feel of an old local Italian joint with long bar area, open kitchen and large pizza oven roaring in the back. The staff was excellent and I can't say enough about the waitress that was running the double duty as the hostess. She really kept everything in check. If you can't tell, I'm in love with this place. I'm already plotting my next trip back."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julianna P.","This place have awesome vibe but is very crowded. Expect to be bump into lot of times. There is really not much space to work with. Food is delicious. Servers are great and very helpful. Parking around the area is a nightmare when you decide to venture out for dinner. Also you will probably be waiting a lot to be seated. Prices are ok."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ben C.","My hunt for my favorite pizza place in Seattle brought me here tonight. This is obviously a very popular establishment; even on a Wednesday night it was fully packed with a wait.
Living by the motto that any pizza is a personal pizza if you just believe in yourself, I ordered a margherita pizza. Really, if a neapolitan is done well, this is all you need.
The dough is paper thin yet doesn't get super crispy, aside from the proper scalding that the crust itself takes. The pizza is also well flavored, and very fairly priced for what you get. Overall I'm definitely a fan and will surely make it back here."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Allison D.","Have been coming here since it opened several years ago and they continue to be a neighborhood favorite for all the right reasons. Consistently great food, fun drinks menu, friendly service, great ambiance and a place to run into your neighbors. As the neighborhood changes and provides a larger restaurant mix we're more apt to find ourselves seated next to someone who has ""traveled"" from Madison Park or Belltown because BDC's reputation has spread, and deservedly so. The owners remain present and engaged, keeping the quality high. They've created a great menu, which is broad enough to offer something for most everyone, but small enough that attention to detail remains. Last night's squash blossoms were amazing, as was the cucumber, sun gold tomato and Burrata plate. So glad we managed to save room for the Affogato for dessert. Another lovely evening."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lauren P.","Absolutely love this Neapolitan style pizza place. They cook them just right and make some good appetizers that I think must rotate. We have had meatballs that were perfectly seasoned with the best texture: not too dense, not too meaty. The atmosphere is very welcoming and we haven't had to wait for a spot, as there's typically space at the bar when all the tables are full. Definitely recommend if it you're open to pizzas other than Chicago/NY style."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","Totally floored that it has been over three years since my third visit to Bar del Corso in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood (7/14/17).
After another 10 hour workday, I drove in southbound traffic from Lynnwood (630pm Friday!) blasting my stereo with the occasional expletive....but darn it, I was on ravenous mission to have a real dinner. Lunch was via work vendor machine and long depleted.
Surprisingly, there was not crowd waiting for a table! I was able to be seated at 730pm on a Friday, come as you are, with no reservations...almost unheard of these days. Perusing the menu, one can practically feel the stress and fatigue melt away.
The outdoor seating, bar area, and indoor dining area were fairly full which kept the wait staff hopping and the conversation din dialed up. Lots of visual distractions from art work, food presentation, people watching which enhanced my dining experience.
Nice selection of beverages, especially with a full bar. Ordered a pint of local brew ($5.50), and for me copious refills of iced water.
Starter small plates, but generously sized, selected the Vongole alla Marinara ($10) with house bread and Burrata with heirloom and cherry tomatoes ($11). The latter was literally summer on a plate...creamy burrata on crostini, sweetest tomatoes, enhanced by the fresh basil, evoo, sea salt, and balsamic vinegar. Mmmmm!
Pizzas arrived well timed from their lovely Italian wood fired oven. Definitely experienced pizzaiolos! One also receives large shears to cut slices as big or small as you want. Last time I saw this was at the late Pizzeria Gabbiano.
Got filled up on starters, so boxed up the Romana ($13.50) with added mozzarella di bufala ($3.50) and the highly recommended Funghi ($14). This one had Crimini mushrooms, housemade sausage, cherry tomatoes with fontina and pecorino cheeses. Perfect composition!
Dessert were slices of Chocolate Hazelnut Gianduja cake served warm with whipped cream ($8 each). Just wished it had little to no powdered sugar.
Murphy's Law the gaming teenager, The Homie, texts me and now decides he's starving. So I placed an additional takeout order for Suppli al Telefono (aka aracini, $6) and Polpettine ($10)...the latter are 5 massive meatballs in sauce, not a Star Wars emperor. More slices of house bread were also kindly included. Kept piping hot enroute to Shoreline.
Also, bought a $25 gift certificate for my DPT who just moved from Mercer Island to Beacon Hill. Figured get him acquainted with a terrific, well established neighborhood spot!
Bar del Corso remains well worth the visit. Welcoming. Pleasant staff. Excellent cuisine. Just knocked off one collective Yelp star because of the wait during peak time, tried to turn our table over sooner as the later crowd was resurging. Also, the chairs aren't designed for lingering.
By all means, definitely do not wait over three years between visits! Praiseworthy, therapeutic dinner!"
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Roccella C.","First and foremost, we would like to establish that we love Bar Del Corso and will never stop eating here. It's delicious. The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. It's easily our favorite restaurant in Seattle. The service is hit or miss, but usually great. Five stars, because we are loyal customers and the only complaint we really have is:
1) The Burrata & Eggplant Caponata - it's so incredibly sweet you cannot taste the eggplant. Eggplant & burrata are STRONG ingredients that can usually stand alone as the sole focus of a dish. Unfortunately the only flavor we picked up on was balsamic.. :( please bring back the old burrata!
2) The baked cod in place of the cod fritters. Not great, and needed a bit more salt? And a touch too greasy... again, please bring back the old fritters! They're too good!
Outside of this, still one of the best spots in Seattle for Italian bites. Will continue to dine here and always encourage others to check it out!"
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Matthew R.","I first heard about this restaurant through the Lyft Podcast - Pick me Up on my commute home to Seattle from Bellevue. It was a great story of how the current owner came to own the restaurant after the original one relocated to Kentucky.
This single podcast influenced my dinner choice that evening and we came from our place in Downtown Seattle and really enjoyed the food.
This place has much charm and the new owners Guy and David are great hosts and have a great team behind them.
I've had everything from scallops to chicken fettucini alfredo to wild boar ragu and more. I'm primarily and old world wine fan and apprecite their selection.
Fast forward to now, we live in the Mount Baker neighborhood and go about every three months and things are consistenly great and we've brought many out of town visitors here over time.
Whether you live in the neighborhood or outside, it's a great gathering for friends or family!"
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Briana N.","I always drive past this place.... Didn't realize how popular it was.
I ordered the Ragù alla Bologna which is a meat sauce with wide, thick noodles. The sauce was very flavorful.. had a strong meat taste.. more so than a marinara taste. The pasts was garnished very lovely. They also give you bread while you're waiting....
I ordered a red wine which paired perfectly with my meal but forgot the name. Our server was very helpful with recommendations..
This restaurant has a great view of downtown but it's pretty crowded on Saturday's, so making a reservation might be helpful."
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica N.","Best part about this restaurant is how warm and friendly it is. First time trying it out and the owners treated us like family. Made the dining experience in a cute neighborhood spot that much more enjoyable.
Food was also great! Favorite dish was the prawn and scallops saffron pasta. Expensive but worth it. Comes with two huge prawns that's are To. Die. For. Bolognese pasta was the other main dish we got... unique dish with a burst of flavor, but wasn't my personal favorite. Caesar salad was a nice way to start off our meal. Not overly dressed but still had lots of flavor... beware of garlic!
Tiramisu for dinner was creamy but very good. And the pistachio gelato with chunks is pistachios in it was another hit. I'll definitely be back!"

The owner seated us next to the back windows where the unexpected view into downtown Seattle was so spectacular! We started with the bruschetta, it was good.

Try this place, you'll love it! Support our

Adorable little place overlooking the city. Great spot to go for birthday! My husband took me here and in the reservation happened to say it was my birthday. They gave us the best service and were so kind!! Moved us closer to the window with the great view! Also the food was so tasty! They serve homemade bread and we got the risotto cakes which were amazing. The special was crab with parpidelle pasta was wonderful!!! Defn check it out!"
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carol B.","Our favorite neighborhood restaurant! My partner and I live in the area and have to try not to come here every weekend. This is our go to spot when guests are in town. You can't beat the delicious food, quality wine, great views, and kind service. I don't think I need to say anymore, but I will.
Food: Superb Italian food. I've been here enough times to try much of the menu. You can't go wrong with the daily Tortellone. When I last visited it was filled with short rib and tasted perfect. I've also enjoyed their NY strip steak and Wild Boar Ragu. Typically I don't get appetizers because otherwise I get way too full, but their bruschetta is nice and refreshing when I do. Portions are reasonable but I almost always have leftovers to take home, just so I can save room for tiramisu. Honestly, I would come here exclusively for desert. The tiramisu is perfect in my eyes. It is rich and full of flavor.
Wine: Wonderful selection of quality wine. We always stick to reds and take the waiter's recommendations which we never regret.
Atmosphere: It's a beautiful view of the downtown Seattle skyline with the mountains in the background. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I always make a reservation, but I don't think one is always necessary.
Parking: limited street parking, but its always free."

It was cute ambience tucked away with a pretty nice view in the back. We waited quite a while for our food so we filled up on bread because we were hungry. The bread was good, salad was good, pasta was ok. My friend ordered a seafood dish and it was extremely fishy.. didn't seem very fresh but wasn't inedible. I had the bolognese which was fine. Staff was very nice although one waiter was spread pretty thin amongst all the tables."
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Priyanshu J.","We have been to That's Amore twice. Our first visit was on valentine's day 2016 and the next one was on our anniversary in 2019. Both times, we have left with smile on our faces.
The service here is top notch! Everyone at the restaurant is friendly and go above & beyond to make your visit special. On oyr anniversary, not only we had the best table with an incredible view of Seattle skyline, we were presented with a beautiful handmade card that we are going to keep forever. We felt special and it totally made our day.
Coming to food, it was amazing in both our visits. The bread served is one of the best breads we have had (and do try the vinegar, it has incredible flavor). We also tried the Risotto cakes for appetizer which were really good.
But, the star of the show was the pasta with chicken and spinach in white sauce. The sauce was amazing and in perfect quantity, so was the pasta and chicken. One of the best pastas we have had!
F8nally, the tiramisu was excellent as well. We would love going back for our next date night!"

There are so many Italian places near us downtown but we are more than happy to make the trek to Mt. Baker. In the past 6 weeks or so, we've gone 3 times, had different dishes each time, and all of them were amazing.
We were lucky enough to be there for NYE when other plans fell through. They did a toast with champagne with everyone in the restaurant and it couldn't have been a better way to end 2018. We will definitely be back!"
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Earnie G.","I promised in my previous review to visit again and update my review. Here's the update. and it's good news. New owner. New chef. New passion.
Longtime That's Amore! server, Guy Devillier, bought the restaurant recently (started in March). A new chef, Richard Holdridge, was put in place in July. And the changes are positive.
On this visit, I tried the wild boar ragù. It was tasty. The seasoning was unique and bold, and the flavors complemented each other. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. My only complaint was the hamburger texture of the wild boar meat. More on that in a minute.
I also tried the flourless chocolate torte for dessert. Another winner. Dark and deep chocolate flavor in a dense torte. Sounds like about half the desserts are made in house now. And the others are made by ""a retired baker who makes them just for us,"" according to my helpful server, Cindy. I'd still prefer all the desserts be made in house. Hopefully, they will get there eventually.
Cindy was an excellent server. She was informed, friendly, and helpful. I asked her to recommend the best dish on the menu, and that's how I ended up with the wild boar ragù.
I chatted with Guy after my meal, and I was impressed by his passion and love for this place. For example, we spoke about the boar ragù. He brought it up and mentioned they were thinking about making the meat larger pieces instead of the hamburger texture because the wild boar was too good a meat to make it into hamburger. I shared that I agreed and thought a pulled pork kind of texture would be great. It will be fun to see where the dish goes.
Which means, I will be back. This was a good experience this time, and I feel good about spending some of my dining money here. The passion's back, so please visit and fan the flames."

This is the place you want to be! They have specials I believe daily if not weekly. The server will let you know and explain each special dish that they're serving you. They will also offer you wine or a beverage to match your dish of your choosing.
From the Mt. Baker area, you can see pretty skies and some parts of the city! I ordered the Lasagna and it was delicious. The red sauce was well seasoned and put together. I went with my family, it was my cousins birthday and they can accommodate group sizes. I would call in advanced because this place is not that small, however if it's packed you'd have to wait. I'd come again to dine."
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","The high Yelp rating attracted us to this neighborhood Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy inside which I'm driven to. They have a mostly Italian wine list. Took us a few tastes to find something we liked. Started with the Caprese Salad. This was the best part of the meal. Heirloom tomatoes, grilled eggplant, mozzarella. Everything fresh and a good sized serving for $12. The entrees were mostly pasta and started at $20. Had the Risotto Florentine. Spinach risotto with three large shrimp. The dish was smaller than I imagined as it was $26. To be honest, it was average at best. While the shrimp were good, the rest of the dish was bland and left me still hungry. We decided to skip the dessert after be underwhelmed at dinner. Possibly, I ordered the wrong dish? Maybe should have gone for pasta. Service was good but he never stopped back by to see if we enjoyed our meal. Guess he knew the answer."

The service was great and the waiter was nice. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a raspberry Italian soda. I would give it a 5 star rating but my sisters meatballs came out too red in the middle.

"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Adam P.","A true neighborhood restaurant, that's worth traveling far outside your neighborhood for.
To simply call this an ""old school"" Italian restaurant doesn't do it justice. It is old school in classic, sophisticated, but unpretentious setting. Even more so in the service, and how the owner and wait staff will treat you like you're an old friend of theirs who has been frequenting the spot for years even if it's your first time walking in.
But the food is something else entirely. Not only do they nail the classics (including the best chicken piccata you ever tasted), they're inventive enough to keep up up with any Cap Hill or Downtown joint you see on a Seattle Times best of list. Try their wild boar ragu if you want a perfect example.
Exceptional restaurant. Can't recommend enough."
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carol Y.","WORST Italian food EVER, I regret selecting this restaurant for an important occasion.
It wasn't just me, every single person in my party was extremely disappointed with the food, including my parents visiting Seattle from another country, my bf who was meeting my parents for the first time, and my bf's sister, brother in law and little niece who drove all the way from Olympia. Yes we had a big table by the window and appreciated the nice view of the Seattle skyline, and yes our service staff was friendly and helpful, but none of that helped when the food sucked.
Look at my photos of the dishes, great presentation and plating right? That's what I thought too! And I couldn't wait to put the food in my mouth! But after I did my heart sank, and everyone saw my smile turned into frown. WTH? The wild boar was supposed to be slow cooked and tender but mine tasted like rubber. And no seasoning?? The risotto was hard and smelled funny (we suspected melted goat cheese was used in the sauce which wasn't listed on the menu), the chicken on top was again lack of seasoning, how do you call that a ""special""? I call it specially bad. And don't even get me started on the fettuccine dish, the feedback was that there was no trace of cheese which was supposed to be an important ingredient. Who was cooking for us exactly? Some intern chef? Ugh. I'm getting upset again as I'm writing this review, I could have picked any other place in the city and I'm sure it wouldn't have ruined a special night. Oh the bill wasn't cheap either.
Two lessons learned: 1) Trying a new restaurant is always risky, don't do it when you have an important occasion. 2) Good yelp rating doesn't always guarantee a good experience"
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle S.","This is probably one of my favorite Italian restaurants... I mean the pasta, guys! The noodles are thin, nothing I've ever seen before. We found this hidden gem recommended by my boyfriend's friend. It was at the very top of Rainier in south Seattle. Such a cute, small little restaurant and if you're lucky like we were (twice), we got a seat next to the window with an amazing view of the space needle.
Easy to find street parking(free). No reservations needed. I got the pasta shrimp carbonara that was soooo good. This was our second time here and I am already dreaming about coming back more often. Seriously the pasta noodles are what makes this restaurant different. My boyfriend and I have found our favorite go-to for delicious Italian food. Our server was nothing short of sweet.

Both of the times we got top notch service and the food is amaaaazing.
The first time we went here was before they changed their menu and the old menu definitely looked more like typical, classic family-style Italian restaurant whereas the new menu seems more modern, but they did keep lots of their old specialty dishes on the new menu. This time around i ordered the fruiti di mare - the scallops were perfectly cooked and noodles so al dente! We always finish with dessert, and the flourless chocolate cake is seriously to die for!!"

Staff was very nice, but the food was...odd, especially given how much love this place gets. The sauce on the lasagna was overly sweet, which took over the dish. My Florentine risotto was an unusually small portion of risotto that was blandly flavored. The presentation was pretty, with three large shrimp and an orchid on top, but not enough to justify the price tag. The chicken piccata sauce was creamy, which is another odd choice for a traditional dish. The Alfredo was good, but our server forgot to add the shrimp, meanining it arrived 5 minutes later on a side plate looking somewhat sad and dejected, with no presentation. (She said it was coming whne I asked her, but then I watched her go and order it from the screen. At least she didn't charge us for it.) Finally, this place is really, really loud when it's full. It was really hard for all of us to hear our conversation by the end of our meal.
I'm glad this is a nice neighborhood joint for the locals, but we came from a ways away because of the reviews. We won't make the trip back again."

The good...ZOMG. the food. I don't even know where to start? The brussels sprouts are so good that they kind of defy reason. The pizzas are outstanding, I especially love the mushroom pizza with a hint of truffle oil. The salads are spectacular, and don't even get me started on the buffalo mozzarella with marinated tomatoes on the side. The rigatoni is rich and flavorful and chock full of meat and sauce and maybe magic.

The bread is more like a pizza dough and not a bread, but it went well with the prosciutto we ordered.

Yelp has listed ""not recommended for large groups"" and I definitely agree- but that hasn't stopped our friends from choosing Bar Cotto. They always do their best to accommodate, but it can be a little bit of a wait.
I had the Night in Parma and enjoyed my drink- although I think it was a little light on the alcohol. My boyfriend had two cocktails that were heavy on the alcohol so I'm not sure about the consistency of experiences here.
It's a nice cozy place that we've enjoyed eating/grabbing a drink at. It's classier and not as grungy as most of the bars lower on the hill. I don't like pizza (weird I know), but I find Bar Cotto's pizza some of the preferable kind. It's not overly greasy or cheesy and I like the unique toppings.
My favorite here is the Brussels sprouts though. I don't like Brussels sprouts at all, but something about these actually made me unable to stop eating them! I've also tried the meatballs and would stay away (kind of bland and flavorless). Their appetizers are a little on the pricey side, but I think their pizzas/pastas are pretty reasonably priced for the amount you can get and share.
Overall I've had great experiences here and would recommend it if you're in the area. I'm not sure I'd recommend walking all the way up the hill for Bar Cotto from the main downtown area, but it's a great stop if you're headed that way anyways."
"Bar Cotto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cotto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Angela Y.","A decent place for some Neapolitan style pizza. I got the mushroom pizza and a beet salad. The pizza had truffle oil on it and the truffle flavor comes through pretty well. I'd want to come back and try something with the red sauce though. The beet salad was also good with pistachios, greens and goat cheese."
"Bar Cotto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cotto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wendy K.","Dropped in here before a chef's table event at Adana called Eat with your Eyes with local artist Dozfy. I loved the staff here friendly and helpful. When I said We probably weren't going to eat cause we were dining across the street our waiter didn't make me feel guilty. In reality we ordered a couple items off the HH menu not certain what portions size we would have at dinner. Our waiter said they had a great relationship with Adana and he was excited for us to try their food.
When my cousin found the drink she ordered wasn't quite to her liking the waiter didn't hesitate to say he'd have something else made instead, she was much happier with second drink. We definitely will come back for drinks and pizza we saw the pizza at another table looked delicious"
"Bar Cotto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cotto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Camille W.","So glad I finally got to try this place out. Holy moly it is amazing. We came around 8:30 on a Wednesday night & it was pretty mellow and felt cozy. It was a casual weeknight and I recommend coming around happy hour as it can be pricey. Perfect place for date night - they have the ambience with the candle at the table and mood lighting on point. Their menu has antipasti, plenty of pizza options, pasta, and a full bar.
My hubby ordered an old fashioned and myself a house red. Both drinks were superb. I wish I could've watched our server make the drink. It was smooth, a little sweet, and cold. They used a black cherry, which I found to be neat as I've never seen that being incorporated into an old fashioned cocktail.
Our pizza choice was the funghi - essentially a mushroom pizza. If I could get this again I would! It was delicious! Sooo cheesey, mushrooms were cooked perfectly (tender and just the right amount of oil), and some basil leaves on top. The crust was the perfect balance, chewy, but crispy by the crust, with just the right amount of char. The pizza comes out with chili oil and red pepper flakes. I'm assuming the chili oil is Calabrian chili oil which made the dish extra spicy. So good. We are pizza snobs and enjoy a good wood fired pizza and so glad this is just a few blocks away from our place. I can't wait to come for HH and try more!"

The 1st wine was a recommendation from the server, which was a white burgundy that went well with all of the food.
The pizza was amazing and might possibly be my new favorite Neoploitan style pizza on Capitol Hill. The meatballs were so zesty #loved. The Ceasar Salad could have been passed on. It was overly drenched in dressing.
The service was great. Had the opportunity to have a lovely chat with Brandon the owner and I will be back.
To reiterate I loved how zesty the tomatoes sauce was on the meatballs and pizza. So many places have bland tomatoe sauces and that's no concern here."

It was kind of on a whim, after a long drawn out conversation about where to go for dinner, we remembered there was that pizza place around the corner we'd mentioned wanting to try.
We just missed happy hour, unfortunately, as the HH prices are really solid and the regular menu is a bit on the pricey side.
We each got a cocktail (midnight in Parma for me, love the gin/lambrusco combo), then bruschetta for apps, and two pizzas (the A&O and the funghi).
Cocktail was great, just what I needed after a long day. The pizza was really nice, love that thin, tasty crust. The funghi is very subtly truffle-y, just the right amount. Honestly, though, the bruschetta was banging and I'd come back just to eat that.
That amount of food was perfect for two hungry people and the service here is nice, too. Ambiance is perfect for a date night as well."

Their sides here: salad and charred broccoli were underdressed and small portioned.
Pizzas: the anchovy pizza was great; crispy and chewy; good balance. The pepperoni was wet and soggy in the middle of the pie. The dough couldn't hold the wet sauce well.
Service: cool guys working here... very attentive and friendly."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Viraj H.","Beautiful place with great food and execution! Cantinetta is a charming little place in Wallingford, which has managed to keep its character over the years.
Went here on a Saturday evening, and thoroughly enjoyed our experience, everything from the decor to service to the food.
The restaurant is beautifully designed, and gives a classy vibe. The ambiance is dark, but could get a little noisy on busy weekend nights.However, it's a perfect place for an intimate date night!
Though the place is pretty large, its popularity keeps it pretty packed, and I wouldn't recommend heading there on weekends without reservations. When we went, every seat was occupied, with more diners waiting to be seated.
Our group got a good variety of food, almost all of which was great. The arancini appetizer was perfectly made, and the focaccia was the best!
Among the pastas, we were blown away by the risotto, but I felt that the tagliatelle was very heavily salted, and didn't enjoy it as much as the other food.
The zeppole was really well made as well, a perfect way to end a meal.
They also have an amazing wine list, and we split a few bottles, all of which were great.
The service was pretty good too. It did get a little slow but with a packed house, that is expected. Our server kept checking on us pretty often, and they had a few other people refilling beverages which helped.
The prices are as expected for a place of this caliber, a little higher than the neighborhood pasta-place. But with the quality of food and service without the pretentiousness, it's completely justifiable.
This is a must go place in Seattle, especially for celebratory night outs or simply date nights. Definitely recommend!"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nelson F.","I think this was my third time there, but I never wrote a review before now.
We arrived a bit early and sat at the bar and had a cocktail while waiting for our table to be ready. The bartender was very busy, but kept checking on us.
Our reservation time came and went, but the hostess kept us informed about what was going on. (The party before us was just taking their time after dinner) No problem, we weren't in a rush.
We got to our table and were introduced to our server Katie. She was great! Very fun, and knowledgeable about the menu.
I was torn between the cacio e pepe tagliatelle and the truffle risotto, and asked if I could get a half order of each. She said they don't do that, but spoke with the chef and was able to put some truffle on the cacio e cepe. It was actually a really good combination!
For dessert, my wife and I split an order of zeppole. 4 balls of warm, gooey, sugary goodness. Two with pistachio sauce, and two with nutella sauce.
We joked that the zeppole was the only reason we were there, but everything we had was excellent.
Cantinetta is part of our regular restaurant rotation!"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ann V.","Such a cute place!
Our bartender was the best! He asked if we've been here before, and when we said no, it was our first time, he automated listed off recommendations from the dinner menu! We ordered all of his suggestions, and they all exceeded expectations! The pork belly was one of the best I've ever had. The gnocchi was soft and pillowy, so delicious and flavorful!
Definitely recommend if you're in the Wallingford area, and looking for a great Italian restaurant with lots of ambiance and excellent service!"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mary G.","Very good Italian food in Wallingford (though there are also locations in Bellevue and I think Madison Park). I ordered the tagliatelle cacio e pepe as my main dish, and I LOVED the noodles. They were chewy, heavy, fresh. I wish there had been a bit more cacio and a bit more pepe on top of them, but the thin sauce allowed the very high quality noodle to shine through. The egg yolk was great to moisten the noodles, too.
The other star of the show was the focaccia our waiter brought to the table while we were waiting for our salads (literally just greens and a vinaigrette, I would rather save the $9 next time). It was like eating a cloud made out of bread! Marvelous texture, salty enough, and amazing olive oil to dip in.
Extensive wine list featuring wines from both Washington and Italy.
This is a good restaurant to come to for a long dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while. We didn't feel rushed by the staff at all, even when the rest of the restaurant filled up with guests. Our waiter was a little odd, but overall the service was good and unobtrusive. I'd recommend ordering one of their delicious pasta dishes as a main course since the second course options were very limited. And flip to the back page of the menu for a chuckle, you'll be glad you did. :)"

Service is impeccable- Ryan is an outstanding waiter. My husband loves a cocktail and has never been disappointed. Now for the food starters such as the clams or burrata or dates are terrific and change with the season. Salads - even the simple mista is flavorful.

"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Candace H.","We had a reservation for a Friday night - at around 6:30, it wasn't full yet and the host let us choose to sit outdoors! :) the host was so warm and friendly and our server was attentive, patient, and fun!
The food was AMAZING. We ordered the...
-Clams: honestly the best clams I've had yet. They were all opened, and flavor was fantastic! They give you a generous amount too!
-Focaccia: so soft and they also give you a generous amount. This came around the same time as the clams so dipping it in the sauce/juices was perfection. Really had to work to not get too full before everything else
-Bolognese: flavor was bomb! They use homemade flat wide pasta noodles - to me their pasta seemed to be on the eggier and al dente side. I LOVE wide noodles though!
-Steak: wow perfect medium rare, flavor was spot on, chew was great! Their fingerling potatoes were so cute, they had 3 halves of potatoes that were each a different shade of potato and it looked like a gradient.
Drinks were delicious and sitting outside under the shades was definitely a wonderful experience. Their indoors look so cozy as well! Food was amazing and so was their service. Definitely would come back again to try more foods!"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dennis D.","Bon-jor-no. Find it in a primarily residential area of Wallingford. It has a intimate and rustic ambience about it- candles and low lighting with some music in the background sets the mood.
I'm not well-versed with Italian food, so the menu had a lot of items and words that weren't familiar to me. The prices are fair- for being a more upscale Italian restaurant, they seem to be expected. I had the Osso Buco- veal shank. It's tender and delicious, over a light sauce to give it more herbal taste. Also the polenta complements it well too. And, the Pappardelle alla Bolognese is a nice pasta dish. The texture has a nice bouncey chewy texture.
I came away impressed. Service is on point and was thorough in explaining the menu in comprehendible words. Fine Italian cuisine paired with wine is always a winning combination."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Audrey C.","We went to Cantinetta on recommendation from a coworker and had a great experience! We ordered the burrata, pork belly, focaccia, tagliatelle cacio e pepe, butternut squash agnolotti, and short ribs- all of which we enjoyed. The highlights of the meal were probably the burrata and agnolotti. The focaccia is also a must try.
Sadly, we were so excited about the pasta we forgot to take a picture of the agnolotti entirely.
Overall, we really enjoyed all of the food and will probably be back!"

We sat in an area where there was a fan right behind us and it was a little awkward, didn't know whether or we should have turned it off or leave it on. Bread was fresh and soft. Ordered lots of the appetizers. The clams were yummy and the broth that it was served in, absolutely delicious!! I even dipped the bread into it. The bolognese was decent. Dishes are more on the pricier side but it is expected."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kelsey H.","With so much ""Italian"" in Seattle lately it's sometimes hard to figure out the gems from the rocks. But Cantinetta is differently a gem. Fresh ingredients, ever changing menus, phenomenal service. Fair prices.
We chose to sit outside, which got a little chilly- but they have heaters! Only complaint was the chairs on the patio are not very sturdy.
The focaccia is different than most others I've had, it's so dense and also very addicting. Both pastas were al dente and creative and decent portions. We shared the special Copper River Salmon, and now I get the hype. Served over a succotash of sorts. We loved this dish. No room for dessert- but hoping to be back soon.

"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mattea D.","Valid average rating yelpers (4 stars). Had a reservation for 5:30 tonight. Street parking but not hard to find, got seated right away.
Menu is straight Italian, I think it varies? Waited awhile to get the server back at the table to order. We got the burrata, baby beets, pane (focaccia) and for mains, rissoto and pappardelle.
The server was pretty helpful and advised us not to over order when we inquired about portion sizes. Helpful, if not overly attentive.
The burrata was ok, tomato and burrata with olive oil and some salt and pepper and micro green garnish. My friend wished it had some basil or pepper or something to add a bit more to it. The tomato looked a little rough.
The baby beets (ricotta, pickled huckleberry, red and yellow beets with olive oil) was great. I loved it, and I normally don't go crazy for ricotta.
We waited a bit for the bread. It was pretty good, a little crumbly, definitely fresh. Olive oil for dipping was delicious.
After a wait the risotto came and it was a bit of a disappointment (risotto, chanterelles, truffle, chicken stock or something?) It tasted a little like fancy rice a Roni plus chanterelles and truffle at the end. The pappardelle was good - friend really liked it. I'm into a bit more sauce myself, but the flavor was on point.
All in all, I would definitely come back but I'm not in a hurry. I thought the hangar steak and the market fish (halibut) sounded amazing."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brian L.","We came here for restaurant week back in November. The homemade bread they serve is awesome and is dense and flavorful. For our mains we had Cacio e Pepe (which I'm sad to say tasted was more like fettuccine Alfredo with black pepper) and the sausage and gnocchi (which was good!). The star of the meal was the Panna Cotta (dessert). Not a dish I would think I'd ever get all that excited about but holy moly was it good. I'll be going back some day just to eat it again."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Geoff P.","About three bites into our two entrees, I turned to my date and said: ""This could be the best Italian in Seattle."" By the end of the meal, after I ordered another (second) pappardelle to share, I was convinced this is the best Italian in Seattle. We had a bottle of Barbera, which was also divine. The one weakness, if any, was the appetizers. The dates wrapped in pancetta were divine, however.
The highlight was the pappardelle, no doubt. Show-stopping. I'll be back to have it again. Probably within the week. Outstanding food, great service (they were busy), and a great atmosphere for groups of 2-4.
Overall 4.8/5 with the lack of versatility among appetizers as the only weakness."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sarah K.","I have to say I was very disappointed by this place. There is SO much good pasta in Seattle, but sadly not here. I had the gnocchi and was very disappointed. The clams were delicious."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda K.","I took my boyfriend here for a dinner date after he had a really long week at work. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but never got around to it. One thing to know about this place is it's literally located in a neighborhood, so do not be fooled when looking for it.
I quite like the decor at Cantinetta. It's rather rustic, and perfect for a night out. The servers are extremely friendly. It was a little busy, despite it being around 5:30. The bread is soft, and served with a fragrant olive oil.
Alex chose a flank steak for dinner, while I went with a black pepper tagliatelle. Alex's steak was resemblant of carne asade, and was served with (according to him) a yummy blackberry jam and fingerling potatoes. My pasta was tossed in a cream sauce with pork cheek, peavines, then topped with an egg yolk. Personally, I thought my pasta was a bit salty for me, but with the bread, it was fine. I absolutely adored the pork cheek because I am a big fan of pork belly. The peavines were a nice addition to the pasta. The pasta was cooked nicely, but I would've preferred maybe a little bit more al dente. Alex seemed to enjoy his steak, and said he would come back again for it (he's picky about steak).
Definitely check this place out!"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","I revisited Cantinetta - Seattle for the third week of Seattle Restaurant Week this evening 10/29/17. I had visited preYelp days twice before - once sat outdoors with the college friend, second visit was with the fam in the main dining area. It had been years though between visits. Seattle has quite a large assortment of Italian restaurants to choose from!
I just dropped off a family member up for a Halloween event way up north, but it being a Sunday early evening had no issues on I-5 Southbound and arrived at my Wallingford destination way too early for my 7pm reservation. So I sat in my car going through texts and debated whether to check out Union Saloon at the corner....nah, I decided to see if I could be seated 45 minutes earlier. Not a problem with the hostess and I seated myself on the far right of the bar counter.
Holy lord, what an amazingly hot and handsome, personable bartender! Dealt with all the beverages, orders, and checking in with all of us at the wrap around counter with finesse. This was a nice diversion since the rest of the bar counter were a smattering of solo (like myself) and pairs of diners.
I even had to smirk when the woman to my left asked if the arancini contained potatoes. The H&H bartender replied it was rice. I only knew this early on due to Mario Batali's early days on the Food Network, a particular episode of Montalbano on cable, and the killer arancini at Bar del Corso on Beacon Hill, I digress.
And those six chatty women to my right waiting for their table. Initially, it was like dining on an airplane stuck in the middle seat, but with incredible food. I was the unobtrusive diner, but *wow* this was a dinner that was totally on point with quantity and quality. I was so busy earlier today, that I forgot lunch so this meal was perfect.
I had a Bedford's Ginger Beer (local from Port Angeles) with a slice of lime and an iced water, none of that stupid tepid water crap served at other establishments. I was kept hydrated.
Starter: Lopez Island Clams with Nduja Sausage, shallots, and white wine - delicious, succulent, and the broth begged for some artisan bread to dunk. Thank goodness for a big spoon!
Main: Papparadelle alla Bolognese....tender homemade pasta and meaty sauce with a bit of a kick. I ate only half and boxed the rest, because I needed to save room for dessert. Most likely this will be The Homie's lunch for school tomorrow.
Surprise item: The kind hostess gave me a free espresso demi-tasse. This was perfect to cut any potential sweetness from the final dessert course.
Dessert: Zeppole - a pair of freshly fried dough and coated with ginger sugar, with dollops of Nutella and mascarpone. Delish with the espresso!
Big splurge for a solo dinner, but following orders from my sennin-so practitioner to be indulgent and do more things that makes me happy. And yes, this was a great dining experience from start to finish. Make sure to keep Cantinetta on your culinary radar screen! Excellent SRW selections!"

I will echo the other reviews that say the focaccia here is abnormally dense but somehow really good. Note that you have to order it explicitly -- it's not complementary like some other Italian places, but well worth it. Our appetizer salads were also great!"

Plates were damn near licked clean. The drinks were perfect. Every part of our experience was wonderful and we can't wait to go back.

Ordered the clams and the bread basket. The clams were really good. Nice portion but expected for the price I guess. They did have a nice spice to it because of the chili oil. It also came with really well grilled bread. The bread basket was the same bread but without the nice grilling. I was so confused with some taste in the bread but I realized it was the olives that were in the bread. Wish it didn't have that. Partner thought the bread basket bread was too hard, particularly the crust. And it wasn't as nice as the grilled bread that came with the clams.
Also ordered a cherry blossom drink which was average. Didn't really taste like a cocktail but just the prosecco."

We ordered the Arancini balls which were ok, margarita pizza with sausage (good), short rib parpadelle was ok at best. The meat was really tender but the parpadelle should have been run through a thinner setting on the pasta machine and for the love of food salt your pasta water! The seafood ravioli was by far the worst dish of the evening! The flavor was simply off and even though you expect a cream sauce to be rich and heavy simply everything on the dish was heavy. How did they make shrimp feel heavy?!??
In short save your $$$ and go to one of Seattle's 1000 restaurants"

During my second time at Tribeca, I decided to order off the dinner menu and get chicken picatta, which was also very good. That creamy, slightly lemony sauce is all you need to go with the pasta!

$25 for an average sized pasta dish also seems a bit pricey, but perhaps that's the norm for this part of Seattle.

The place had a classic and modern interior. We ordered a pasta and bruschetta. The pasta had a strong taste of the olive oil and tomatoes. It had seasoning that mixed really well with the olive oil. The bruschetta's tomatoes were a little over done. I liked the pasta more than the bruschetta.
The food came in a timely manner and the waitress's checked on us just the right amount. I would come here again for the pasta."

"Tribeca Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tribeca-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Emily J.","My friends just moved near by this place so it was easy to walk to for happy hour after work.
For food, we shared the mac & cheese with sausage. It was really good and if I go back, I will definitely be ordering it again. Not eating for awhile and a drink may have played into how good I thought it was though.
We had also ordered the meatballs but they never came. Turns out the waiter did not hear us even though he repeated what we ordered back to us out loud for us to confirm... oh well. Will just try them next time!
For the drinks, I ended up trying the Cherry Blossom and the Italia. Both were sweet and fruity. Not strong to the point that they were too strong for me to drink, but enough to know there was definitely alcohol in there.
The bar fills up pretty quickly after 5. If you are looking to get a table for happy hour, recommend getting there sooner than later. The night we went, lots of groups showed up hoping for tables and the place is not big at all. The counters at the bar were filled up and so were the tables. The staff made accommodations for one group to squeeze into the back but there weren't enough bar tables for everyone who was showing up.
The vibe in the place was happy and filled with people celebrating they were off work. Probably the night out type of feels you get on a Friday night even though it was a Thursday."
"Tribeca Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tribeca-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Lena W.","I was part of a group of 30 or so folk for lunch today. We had a limited menu developed based on the size of our group and it worked well. Our server, Jan (pronounced Yon), was incredible. There was another server assisting him but I didn't catch her name.
The food was incredible. Fresh made pasta and salads. I selected the rigatoni and meatballs and was so pleased. Everyone else was also pleased with their items ranching from the Tribeca Salad to the Stuffed Ravioli. The food was fresh, hot, and well-seasoned.
Service was great and so was the food. They don't have a large private room but I definitely recommend this spot for your group."
"Tribeca Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tribeca-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","William G.","Once again, we've walked by this place SO many times, always looked intriguing, but stuck to the tried and true. Not this time! Oh my gosh, what an all-around great experience! This is not Elegant Dining, but definitely Fine Dining. We were a bit concerned when we entered due to the huge crowd at the bar and the noise level, but there was a holiday party going on, my guess is its normally quieter.
And again, so many great options to choose from on the menu!! All their pasta is made in-house from flour imported from Italy. We started off simply with the bread basket, no, it's not free, but it was great, nice crust on the outside, moist and chewy inside, the way we love it. The rosemary and olives incorporated in the bread made it perfect.
After much deliberation, I got the Frutto Di Mare, a seafood soup similar to Cioppino, paired with a glass of Dimajo Sangiovese. My wife got the Salmon Risotto and a Sauvignon Blanc. We were both thrilled with the meal! My meal was absolutely spectacular, wonderful layers of intense flavor, lots of seafood, great squid ink pasta. The salmon was cooked exactly to my wife's instructions, and was beautifully presented. AND, the wines were really good, and only $10 a glass! In Seattle!!
So, don't be like me, and just keep walking on by - walk in and give it a try!"

We decided to go there because it was a little bit more casual for lunch and it had great reviews. We had the egg plant Parmesan sandwich, the chicken Parmesan sandwich, and a margarita pizza. All of them were delicious! The fries that they have our steak fries and those fries are crisp and delicious! Unfortunately, the service was not that great, it took about one hour to get our lemons for water. I am noticing that a lot of the restaurants here and Seattle charge a 20% service charge regardless. With that being said, the service definitely is not as good as it normally Would have been if it was not a mandated service charge."
"Tribeca Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tribeca-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Ben B.","We wanted a bite to eat before returning to the hotel and this place was surprisingly good.
Ordered the meat balls to share (enough for 2 if you're looking for something small to kick off) followed by a beetroot salad with a side of salmon and the beef fillet. Both were excellent and my steak came exactly how I asked. If you like your salmon a little more cooked rather than pink in the middle best to ask, I'm not a fan of really undercooked salmon unless it's sushi. Nice atmosphere and not noisy, clean and tidy to boot.
Service was prompt and friendly which suited us as we were both tired! It looked like this place could get busy, this was a Tuesday and fairly early evening (5:45 ish) so I would recommend booking ahead if there are more than 2 dining.
All in with a large bottle of sparkling water, with tip, came to $97. For great service and really good food it was well worth it. I didn't take a picture of the joint a it's nothing particularly special, typical downtown building with a restaurant in it."

Today we had good service, pleasant, efficient and quick, as we dined here for lunch. Just as before.
I had the Veggie Mushroom burger with Gruyere cheese and a side salad.
My other half had the BLT. She loves this sandwich here.
The burger was the perfect blend of fresh mushroom, grilled just right.
Gruyere cheese, melted to just the right temperature, relaxed but not dripping, and the bun was warm, soft and delicious.
Overall, we are pleased we gave them another chance and are looking forward to next meal here."

squid ink calamari pasta was salty as heck.
kids cheese pizza was eh...
garlic bread was probably the best thing we had if it weren't for the bland tomato dipping sauce.
osso bucco was pretty expensive and also lacking in mind blowing flavor. i would have expected the osso bucco to be more tomato-ey if you get my drift. for a place like this in a prime area and for the price they charged, i would have expected more. will probably not visit if in the area again."

"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Abigail L.","What a lovely restaurant!
I enjoyed a meal alone here tonight for dinner and it was PERFECT. The place has a lively ambience with a homey feel to it. I don't know if it's the brick walls with the window view I had during the pouring rain and the street trees decorated covered with Christmas lights, but I felt so relaxed which helped me enjoy my meal even more. The glass of wine may have helped too lol.
I tried a glass of the 2017 Chianti red with the focaccia bread for appetizer, followed by a dish of the linguine clam pasta. The other other place I've really enjoyed a linguine clam pasta so far is at Carraba's in Houston, but I have now found my linguine place in Seattle.
I took my time since I was here alone and it was the most relaxing hour I've had all week!"
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Steve D.","Actually visited here twice this past week; must have had a hankerin' for Italian.
Summary - you sorta have to visit the place; the food is pretty good and the waitstaff are even better; was a super pleasant experience, unlike my prior experiment over at Anada...but I digress..
Good drink/wine selection (but I don't consider myself any good at wine selection; so darn confusing so I tend go by the recommendations and the length of wine list.
Varied selections for dinner, lots of options. Had the crispy octopus, and it was actually tasty (my first time); had the salmon and it was pretty good, had the meatball appetizer and it was awesome, and also had the lasagna bolognese and it was large enough to feed a trucker, but was really good, and I took it home. my buddy had the rigatoni , which had some spicy sausage and he ate it all up, looked great.
tried a dessert called the chocolate budino, and it had some very subtle flavors; maybe a sophisticated pudding.
btw, the happy hour menu looks interesting."

Finished with tiramisu ( which I shared with a friend).
Definitely a place to place on the repeat list b"
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ryen B.","Dinner with colleagues, so got to try a good sample of the menu.
- Negroni on tap was basic
- Baby lettuces are fresh and not too heavily dressed
- Beet salad comes with small cubes of roasted beets and a few slices of oranges
- Octopus is nicely cooked, though not a deal at $18
- Burrata was a pretty small serving for $16, but was creamy enough
- Smoked salmon risotto was well cooked. The serving is large and heavy, as risotto tends to be, so a good dish to share
- Rapini- this side was perhaps my fave dish of the night. Nice and garlicky
- Coconut cream pie- exactly what you'd expect. The big slice is plenty to share.
Dishes are safe with options you can find on menus everywhere these days, so good place to go if you don't have adventurous eaters. Nothing blew me away, but no complaints either. Server was friendly. Drinks were fine. Not a place I'd go back to with so many other options in this city, but fine for what it is."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Darin A.","With a rare chance to hang out with coworkers, we chose Cuoco and had a wonderful evening here.
The wild boar ragu with foraged mushrooms was incredible and my only regret was not having more...until it came time for dessert. I can't go to an Italian restaurant and not try the Tiramisu as it gives me a great picture of the quality as well as (hopefully) leaving me with a sweet taste in my mouth about the place as I leave. Cuoco nailed it. It may have broke into my top 5 favorite Tiramisu dishes ever which is really saying something as I come from an Italian town! I walked away from an incredible night with friends having enjoyed good wine, food, dessert, and service. Everything was in place and nothing took away from our time together, which is always the most important part.
Highly Recommend."

***Dined here during the Amazon bring your parent to work day, so the menu was different than usual***"
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Saurabh C.","We were craving Italian for lunch today while visiting friends in Capitol Hill and decided to try this place which has good review on yelp.
Parking was a bit tough even during regular work hours but surprisingly it was not very busy when we made it there with our reservation.
The place had a very rustic and quiet environment with plenty of seating. We were greeted warmly and the service was great.
We ordered the homemade garlic bread and meatballs appetizers. I really enjoyed the meatballs with the tomato sauce it came in with a rich deep flavor. The garlic bread was slightly over cooked but not spectacular and was okay!
For entree we ordered the rigatoni and lasagna. Both of the dishes were delicious and amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed my rigatoni with a flavorful pork sausage chunks in it with a creamy ragu sauce with sweet and spicy flavor.
The portion sizes here are not huge but the right amount with the quality you expect from a Tom Douglas joint. I ordered an affogato as a desert which had a good vanilla bean ice cream scoop and a bit bitter espresso for my taste but I was palatable.
I would give this place a 4 star for the quality of food and service we received. My only knock at this place was the menu choices. It was very limited! I'm not the one who likes a book as a menu but I wish they had more variety of appetizers & pastas. I couldn't pick more than 1-2 items I would want to try there again due to the choices. The drink menu had more choices that food.
The quality of pasta is fresh and you can see its homemade. I wish they would add more pasta choices specifically the carbonara to make me come back. For now if I am craving a rigatoni or lasagna I would definitely try this place again."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jacques I.","Not the best. My friend and I came here for lunch during Seattle Restaurant Week and can't say I'd return anytime soon.
Let me just first say the service here was absolutely perfect. We came in during our lunch hour; and notified our server that we were on a time crunch, so that she could expedite service, which she certainly did. She checked in with us throughout our lunch, which led her to offer us a redo of the entree we ordered.
For the two-course $15 Seattle Restaurant Week special, I started with the Lentil Soup and had the Rigatoni for my entree, the same as my friend's entree. Soup was fine, but the Rigatoni was sadly, disappointing. It mostly was from how under-cooked the pasta was, making it too firm in texture. I was hesitant to say anything at first since we were on a time crunch and needed to get back to the office soon, but our server was so concerned with our disappointment that she reassured the kitchen could redo the rigatoni for us to go, in time for when we needed to leave. It was generous of her to offer and she seemed genuinely concerned. If it had not been for her wonderful customer service, I'd cross off Cuoco off my list for good. Plus, once I had the remade rigatoni the following day, the texture of the pasta was al dente/much better.
All in all, Cuoco isn't my favorite Tom Douglas restaurant. And with other affordable pasta eateries coming to town, it just doesn't compare. I'd come back for happy hour and try some bites, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle S.","The food, especially the fresh pasta, is wonderful, and the restaurant is very nice. My main complaint was the service. Our server was clearly uninterested in us once it was obvious we were not going to order drinks (despite the fact that both of us ordered an appetizer and entree, and shared a dessert). The server did not offer us the specials (I could hear them being offered at other tables), took away the bread plates before we were finished, and left me feeling unwelcome. Once the restaurant became busier, we were ignored, and I had to go to the hostess desk to finally ask for the check. Overall, I was left with the impression that since gratuity is included, and my dinner guest and I were not going to buy alcohol and therefore be the highest spenders, that we were unimportant. What a shame."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Golda V.","Four stars go to the drinks. May be it was just what I got but I wasn't all that impressed by the food given all the other great options around the area. I love pasta, but the smoked salmon ravioli dish just didn't do it for me. Something was lacking in the flavor, surprising given how flavorful smoked salmon can be all on its own. However, I have yet to be disappointed by the drinks here, be it the cocktails or the wine I've had. The place itself is pretty nice. Beware though, it can get quite busy and loud here during the lunch rush. In comparison, 3pm here is almost a ghost town, great if you want to get work done. Moscow mules here are pretty good from what I remember. Come here for the drinks, not the food."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Connie A.","My colleague and I decided to make reservations to try out their Seattle Restaurant Week Lunch promotion, and were in anticipation to try out their menu items. When we arrived, we waited a short moment before we were seated. We told the server that we were on a time crunch and she was great in taking our orders swiftly. For appetizers, my friend ordered the baby lentil soup while i opted for the baby lettuce. We both ordered rigatoni with spicy sausage ragu for the entree item.
It didn't take long for our food to arrive. I guess our server placed a note to the kitchen of our time rush and so our food came out relatively quick. But because of this, the quality of our food seemed to have been compromised. First, I was a bit confused by the salad - there were large chunks of celery and I personally just didn't think the vinaigrette dressing paired well with the ingredients. The rigatoni was a bit of a let down. It was undercooked and luke-warm when served. When I bit into the pasta, you can clearly tell that it was not cooked through. Though unimpressed, we continued on with the rigatoni-- until our server stopped by to check on us. When we revealed this to her, she immediately apologized and expressed that this is not the quality they strive for and offered to remake our entrees for us to go. We agreed, and she came back less than 15 minutes later with two to-go boxes, all nicely packed up for us. I really appreciated her ability to reconcile the issue.
Truthfully, the pasta still did not live up to my expectation, especially considering this is a Tom Douglas restaurant. There are plenty of places that make more exceptional pastas at a much lower price. Our server went above and beyond and certainly deserved a 5/5. Food wise, I'm going to have to give 3/5."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ahmed B.","I had only two things on the menu and they were great, so I am a fan. The ambiance and service also was nice so I am adding a star for that.

"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katya S.","This is a perfect example of how reputation of a restaurant can be tarnished by unreasonable reviews. I've lived in the neighborhood for several years, and have experienced dining all across Seattle. I consider myself a foodie and will, without a doubt say that Cuoco has always delivered consistently good food. This is one of the best restaurants in SLU. So ignore the reviews, relax, and order a negroni and a lasagna next time you're in the area.
P.S. The lasagna is even better on the second day."

"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David B.","A fun and excellent happy hour. The food is well presented. Despite being a Tom Douglas joint it is still good. What he has done to Alaska Airlines should be consider a high crime.

It was never high up on my priority list of places to try, but I'm glad I did. That being said, I do agree with the other reviews, Cuoco didn't 'wow' me. It is good, not great.
Hearing people rave about the meatballs, I came in with high expectations. Were they good? Absolutely, but I still can't wrap my mind around what everyone is blown away about... HOWEVER their Capalletti is another story. Our server described it the best way I could imagine ""each bite is like an explosion of cheese in your mouth"". If there is one thing to know about me, that exact phrase is what my dreams are made of, and what my heaven would consist of. So, yes, I have to say their Capalletti is what brings me back. Another fan favorite of ours was their Aged Rib Eye.
All in all, I have nothing bad to say other than maybe I just built the meatballs up in my head too much before going into it, and set myself up for disappointment. :/"
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cory C.","The food was okay, not great and not bad either.

Be careful though because too many and who knows what will happen! LOL! Friends arrived and I of course ordered another Fizz....yum. Our meals were equally as delicious I had the Bolognese which was so flavorful and delicately beautiful. My friend had the Italian chopped salad and the squash bisque which was equally simple but packed with flavor. To end our meal we ordered the zeppoli (mini doughnuts) that came with three sauces. I will definitely be back to try the pizza I saw and get more of the zeppoli and Fizz drink.

"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kenny G.","Wow, what a difference between our last time and this weekend, 7 months later. DISASTER! Went there with seven other members of my family to celebrate 6 birthdays of our 8 person party, and the kitchen couldn't get our food out to us in less than 75, yes 7-5, minutes. No, it wasn't busy, in fact half empty at 615p on Saturday night - not a great sign anyway. During this eternity, we were told the entrees would be right out two separate times, while no manager came to ask what he could do, offer drinks or even complimentary bread. My 86 year old mother commented that it was even worse service than at her rest home. When they finally got some entrees out to us, 3 of the 8 took additional time. The pasta was warm, but not hot, but we were exhausted by that time and just dealt with it.
Server, Phil, was apologetic but the damage had been done. I picked the restaurant, and was embarrassed by the ""fiasco"". In the end, they comp'd 30% off the bill, but with so many choices in Seattle, it would take an extraordinary circumstance for is to return. Maybe the company that owns Fiasco and Pablo y Pablo is the issue, since you either have a culture of serving your customer, or you don't!
Pity..."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica R.","Was really excited to try this spot, but sorely disappointed. Somehow they ruined calamari (so salty even my 8 year old wasn't into it and you could barely taste the squid under all of the breading). Risotto was okay, but underwhelming.
I enjoy a nice ambiance but it was incredibly loud and so dark that the entire restaurant had their phones out in order to read the menu (average age seemed to be mid 30s).
Skip it, go to San Fermo or Piccolino's and your money will be much better spent."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Teresa L.","I must say, this is one of the better Italian restaurants in the Seattle area that's open for lunch.
Came here on a Friday about 15 minutes after they opened. Walked in and was greeted immediately by a friendly server. We were in a hurry so told the server we would like to do take out. She handed us a lunch menu which was simple but had a decent selection of dishes.
We decided on a combo: chop salad with a 6in personal size classic pepperoni pizza. The other dish we selected was the Bucatini with meatball & red sauce.
After we placed our orders, we perused their large wall of wines that were on display. This restaurant has the largest wine selection I've ever seen. After a few minutes, we took a seat on these oversized leather seats. They were actually quite comfortable.
Then our orders came out relatively quickly. Immediately, I got a whiff of that cheesy pepperoni pizza. Almost instantly, my stomach began to speak to me saying, feed me! So, I did.
The pizza's crust was thin and cooked perfectly where it wasn't too crispy nor burnt. It had just the right amount of red sauce. Also, loved the small pepperoni where they curled up into tiny little cups. The best part was the cheese. It was cheesy enough where I had to stretch my arm out while the cheese refused to separate itself from the bite I took.
Next the chop salad! This salad was loaded with chunky salami, cubed provolone cheese, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, sliced pepperoncini, and fresh crispy lettuce. It was served with a refreshing slightly sweet and a little tart dressing. Absolutely delicious!
Finally, the Bucatini meatballs with red sauce. Initial thought after first bite: wow, this dish is flavorful! The red sauce didnt look like much but it was tasty, it even had a tiny spicy kick to it. That surprised me but in a very pleasant way. The noodles were cooked just the way I like it: al dente. Also, the meatballs were just as delightful. They were well seasoned and had a bounce to each bite.
I am definitely coming back to this restaurant to try other dishes. Also, would recommend this place to all the pasta and pizza lovers out there! Bon appetito!"
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christy W.","Great Italian option in the Fremont area. I appreciated the gluten free pasta option (I asked for gluten free pasta with a dairy free red sauce, and they were easily able to accommodate).
There's a large ""wine wall"" in the front of the restaurant where they display tons of different bottles of wine. If you don't want one of the standard bottles of wine offered on the menu, you're able to walk over to the giant wine rack and choose a bottle you wish to drink that night! I thought it was a unique, interactive concept."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle R.","Loved.every.moment!
We sat outside on a nice Seattle evening, enjoying the street chatter. When we ordered our drinks, I couldn't decide and was toying with several of the champagne cocktails, but settled on Prosecco. Our waiter offered to bring me one of the cocktails, the Rinomato, and if I didn't like it he would gladly swap it out. I loved that option, and ended up enjoying his drink recommendation.
We were surprised to find that our waiter brought us a complimentary appetizer, a Prosciutto Bruschetta - PHENOMENAL! Hubs said it was one of his top 5 appetizers ever!! It was topped with mascarpone, prosciutto, basil and honey. It was a wonderful flavor combo!
For my entrée, I selected the Chicken Piccata. It was buttery goodness, lemon was not overpowering and the entrée was very filling. Hubs got a pizza, I didn't hear any complaints.
Even though I was stuffed and very sastified, we ordered donuts for the table. They came with (espresso?) chocolate and caramel sauce and we LOVED them.
I'll gladly be back! Great atmosphere, delicious eats and EXCELLENT service!"
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Steve T.","I'd been here with some friends when it was Thackeray. I didn't have a good experience, so I never went back. However, once it became Fiasco, I'd wanted to give it another shot.
So, a few coworkers and I took some clients out to lunch and selected Fiasco as our location. In from South Korea, we wanted them to have a great experience. Unfortunately, it seems this location is still the same as it ever was.
As soon as we arrived, we were told the kitchen was backed up despite the restaurant only being half full. The biggest offense though was the giant hair one of the clients found in their salad.
Once we notified the waiter, he didn't even apologize. He simply took it back to the kitchen and we had to wait another 15 minutes for a replacement to come out. And when it did finally come out, it was once again without any sort of apology. They still charged us for his meal too."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katrina M.","Went for dinner with friends tonight and really liked this place a lot!
The salads are the best thing in the menu, and the two we had were the Chinky Avocado and the Peach Panzanelle (I may have spelled that wrong).
The avocado salad was filled with chunks of creamy avocado and had a toasted quinoa, which was really delightful. The dressing was yummy and one of the best salads I've had.
The peach salad was tangy and I loved it as well. Not real sure where the peach cane in, but still great all the same.
We also had several of the pastas and the grilled chicken piccata. The pasta and zucchini that came with the chicken piccata were the best part...something addictive with the zucchini seasoning, and although it was really good, the chicken breast was pretty standard.
While I really enjoyed dinner here, I'd like to come back instead for happy hour because a lot of great things on that menu including the avocado salad, and the salads are the real winners here!"
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","Friendly staff and food was tasty, but the value equation was way off. We started with calamari which was very lightly battered and tasted fresh but a very small portion for $12. I ordered a meatball sandwich no bun which came with a nice arugula salad. Came with six meatballs which I was surprised by! My husband got spicy shrimp polenta. The total was $73 with no drinks. The spicy shrimp polenta came with 5 small pieces of shrimp which is absurd for a $25 dish that is mostly cornmeal. The spicy sauce was really good though.
We came here when it used to be Thackeray and liked it too but did feel it was overpriced. This place (still same restaurant group) is even more overpriced it seems."

"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Savannah S.","Great happy hour spot!
The pie + glass of wine for $13 is a steal.
We also got the bread and garlic w/ oil, which was delicious - fabulous bread! The fried artichokes were also delicious, not a super common menu item so was nice to try.
The pizza is delicious, the happy hour size is small but with other apps it is fine. Crispy, thin crust! The wine was alright, but not great.
Excellent service - the waitress dropped one of our pizzas and brought a complimentary salad while they made a new one, which was out moments later.
Would definitely return for happy hour or pizza!

"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Seth O.","First time trying out Fiasco and was well worth the trip. Very comfortable space that can fit a lot of people without being too crowded. The service was great between helping decide on a bottle a wine that you can grab from the wine bar as well knowing all aspects of there menu to decide on what your in the mood for. My wife and I decided on the prosciutto bruschetta to start and each got a pasta dish. You can taste the quality of all the food with each bite. Great spot for a date night or meet up with a group of friends"

"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda R.","I was a fan of Thackeray and was a little surprised to see it's a totally different restaurant!
Same outdoor seating and the interior is bright and colorful with a beautiful bar.
I was a party of 3 whom sat outside. Service was good for the most part; our waitress was lovely but did get slammed multiple times inside so there were moments we were left patiently waiting...
We took advantage of HH for the most part. My phone died before I could photograph all items but here's a breakdown.
-Olives were good, nice citrusy flavor. I've had better but I've had less awe inspiring olives so I would suggest giving them a try.
-Broccolini has a nice flavor, maybe slightly vinegary, but the roasted garlic was a nice touch. There were only 4 pretty thin pieces though so the portion size to price was kind of a bummer.
-Olive bruschetta with goat cheese was yummy. Awesome charred bread and lovely flavor from the toppings. Again, the portion for the price was a little disappointing. Not much of a bite when shared with 3 people.
-Chunky avocado salad, must try!! We loved the vinaigrette mixed with the frisée and generous amount of avocado with pepitas (slightly too salty) and crispy quinoa. Mmmm
-My friend said the Gnocchi was really good; nice texture and a delicious red sauce. Very flavorful.
-Goaty goat goat pizza was great! I love their crust, thing and crispy with a bit of chew. The flavor was fantastic. Highly recommend if you enjoy goat cheese.
Overall, we had a great experience at fiasco. Docked a star only for the moments of lackluster service and (too) small appetizer portions."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brittany S.","I won a pizza party at Fiasco for myself and 9 friends. None of us had been here before and came with moderate expectations. We were all thrilled with the ambiance, food and especially the service. The servers went above and beyond to check in while still giving us the space to enjoy the evening. We also appreciated Claret, the adjacent wine bar, where we could hand select wine to enjoy at the restaurant or take home for a lower price. We left excited to come back and enjoy more items on their menu as well as to take advantage of several of their specials they run throughout the week."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rachel C.","We went on a Friday evening. The service was excellent. Food was just as great. They fresh make the pasta and all the bread/pizza dough, the cheese bread is a must order.
Will definitely recommend this place and come back."
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David P.","Stopped in on opening night and tried out a pizza and a salad. The Don Rafa pizza was a sizeable pizza for one person, and or a good size to share with two people along with a salad if you aren't too hungry. The pizza was a thin crust and had a good flavor profile. The lettuce gem salad was well tossed and crisp.
The restaurant is still owned by the same owners that previously occupied the space and the restaurant itself is a large, open, beautiful space.
Will stop back to try the pastas next time."

"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Neha M.","Downright underwhelming and overly expensive for what they have to offer. I used to like Thackery somewhat - at least their menu was interesting. Fiasco replaced it. While the location and ambience are nice, Fiasco's menu, prices and taste is below average. We had calamari and a pizza. Nothing memorable. Decided not to do the dessert. I heard the wine selection is good but I personally didnt try."
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amira J.","was 100% dedicated to eating this pasta i was given as a take out meal. wow, when i say dedicated i mean i was real serious about savoring each & every flavor!
firstly, i AM NOT a huge red pasta fan but this dish was so promising that i might be turning to the red side. i cannot believe it was this good because sometimes take out can taste different from when you dine in so i can't imagine how good this was dining in!
i got the lamb & beef bolognese rigatoni pasta that was topped with some fine n dandy mozzarella. (y'all)
this was by far the best red sauce pasta i've had. so many intentional flavors that gave my taste buds a dance party. like seriously this was great quality pasta & it wasn't dry! it was good, saucy & had a kick to it. i appreciate this pasta so much & i will be coming back here for more. next visit i will be sure to dine in :)
small portions, but good bc the flavors are SO POWERFUL!"
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phil G.","This well known restaurant in Queen Anne is owned by one of members of Seattle's restauranteur cartel, who own and operate an amalgam of successful, popular restaurants in Seattle. The cartel members with names such as Erickson, Douglas, Dillon, and in this case Stowell, open and close restaurants seemingly at will. All have a following, and all
seem to make money. Some I like, some are just okay. How to Cook A Wolf, even with its obnoxious name, tries hard to please.
The staff is pleasant, catering to the young clientele, playing hip hop and rap loudly on the sound system. The place is tiny, and thus the music was the star on this chilly Sunday night. As always, we sat at the bar and our server, although a bit saccharin and ""over the top,"" was
professional and friendly. The crispy duck leg was fantastic, but the portion very small. My requested classic cace e pepe pasta was overwhelmed by the peppercorns. While the pasta was cooked al dente, the over powering pepper almost made the dish in eatable. My wife began coughing after one taste and waved it off. I ate the pasta because I wanted her to enjoy the duck leg.
Surprisingly, I enjoyed How To Cook A Wolf more than my wife, who was appalled at the pasta; she being Italian. Hey, the kitchen hit 500, that's okay, and makes me want to try it again."
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Edward S.","I had been to other Ethan Stowell restaurants, but this was this first time I drove up Queen Anne hill to eat here. I thought the meal was excellent and I will need to return soon.
His restaurants always have excellent wine lists. Here I ordered the Savage Grace cab franc and it was excellent. The menu consists of small plates and large plates--although some of the small plates are not so small.
I started with Brussels Sprouts and the Burrata. The Brussels sprouts came with a vinaigrette and bread crumbs and were cooked wonderfully. Then I really loved the burrata, it tasted so good on the fennel crackers that came with it.
I had two pastas for large plates, the rigatoni and the tagliarini. Both were good, but I preferred the rigatoni. The lamb and beef bolognese sauce that came with it was incredible then the fresh pasta is so delicious. The pasta with the tagliarini was also great and that dish came with some great mushrooms.
Although I was pretty full, I had the cannoli for dessert. It is a generous one that I could not finish. The shells were flaky and just perfect, but the pistachio cream was out of this world. This was a great dining experience overall."

We started off with the tomatoes, burrata, and shishito peppers and all were good but the burrata was my favorite. It came with salted crisps and some lightly mashed tomato which blended well with the burrata, cutting the richness and adding a complex variety of flavor. The tomatoes were super fresh served on top of reduced balsamic with some basil spread on top and were very tasty. Shishito peppers are always amazing and they found a nice way to distinguish with the crisped bread crumbs and artichoke and while good weren't the best served.
For entrees we split the short rib pasta and the salmon. The salmon was spectacular with crisped edges and served on a great sauce with veggies. The pasta was also super fresh and the short rib added a lot of flavor.
Great spot and will be back when it's not booked the whole night!!"

Great service, amazing food, excellent wine selection. I highly recommend."
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stacy P.","I've had this on my list for over a year now, and now that I live here, I had to make it a point to get in. I understand the process better now, as the restaurant is fairly small, so there aren't too many reservations to be had. We got in on a Monday night, 7:45 reservation. 3 of us.
Sat at the corner table by the window. Note: wear your jacket. There's a reason why there is a rolled up carpet cutting off the draft from the floorboards. I was basically cuddling up with my friend on her leg. lol
The server was pleasant, but distracted. They were understaffed. Our waters came out, we ordered some plates to share, but I was in starvation mode, so I chose the sourdough for 3 to start. At $3 per piece of bread with an accompaniment of garlic and fennel honey butter.... should be good, right? Except two other dishes came out first, with you guessed it, toast pieces or crackers. By the time the bread got there, we had filled up on other carbs. I should've declined the late sourdough arrival.
Dish 1 - Burrata - English Peas, Mint, Fennel Cracker
This was very tasty and the burrata creamy, love the addition of the peas, they were bright and a fresh spring feel to the dish. A bit too much on the olive oil.
Dish 2 - Lamb Tartare - Anchovy Vinaigrette, Fresh Herbs, Garlic Toast
There were some lamb chunks that were sinewy and overall, way heavy handed on the oil. It was like Olive Oil took over. Two bites and I was done. Delightful presentation, but that's where that ended.
Dish 3 - The Sourdough Bread. I think I was already breaded out at that point. The honey butter with the one bite of bread I had was lovely.
Dish 4 - Polenta Fritters - Ricotta, Sage, Chestnut Honey
My favorite dish. Lightly crisp on the outside, and fluffy inside, nice and hot. Sat on top of a sweetly ricotta base and hints of sage. Well done. Bravo!
Dish 5 - Tagliatelle - Wild Ramp, English Pea, Egg Yolk, Prosciutto Brodo
Tasty. Noodles stuck together though. Boring dish overall. Nothing stood out. Next.
Dish 6 - Strozapretti - Pork Belly, Tomato, Calabrian Chili, Pecorino
Tastiest dish of all the dishes. Pork belly was a shade stiff. Still some residual olive oil taste though. Server said the dish would be spicy, it wasn't spicy in the least bit. Definitely the more tasty of the two pastas.
My opinion, overpriced for the quality of food. Bread should always come out first. My palate was so ""olive oil'd"" I'm surprised I didn't get Popeye'd as I left!"
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kayesee S.","Wow this place is really special.
I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday and we both had a wonderful time. The gave us a complimentary glass of champagne because it was his birthday, and put a candle on our dessert. It's those type of details that really make a difference.
The food was also out of this world. You have to try their pasta and the bruschetta is also a not to miss item! I will be back again!"
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Austin H.","This is an amazing restaurant and I loved everything about it. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and it definitely lived up to my expectations. Upon arrival we were greeted with glasses of champagne to celebrate my birthday. We followed that up with some delicious cocktails, I ordered the Patio Season and my gf ordered their house sangria.
As good as the drinks and the cozy dining space were the food was still the star. We got six total items counting dessert. Sea Wolf Sourdough with roasted garlic and fennel honey butter was an amazing start. That came out at the same time as the Hamachi Crudo, which while tasty and wonderful to eat on warmer days would probably be the thing I'd cut first for next time as I'd rather try another pasta or maybe a seasonal small plate. To follow those we had the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta with pickled shallots. Then came the mains. The Cassareccia pasta was absolutely sensational. The short rib was so tender and flavorful while the carrot sofrito gave it some spice. The cheese on top gave it a nice balance. The pasta was a perfect al dente and this was the highlight of the meal for me. A very close second place would go to the Beelers Pork Belly that followed. The pork was fatty yet crispy. The peaches and shishitos that accompanied it were a nice touch and the romesco sauce was heavenly and brought the whole dish together. Both of these mains are must orders as long as they are on the menu and you have an appetite for meat.
After all of this we were feeling full but wanted a sweet treat to end the evening so we split the lemon tart with blueberry frozen yogurt as it seemed like a good choice with the sun setting on us as we closed out our evening. They even served it with a candle on top for me! The service was wonderful throughout the night and we will definitely return. Ethan Stowell continues to be one of my favorite chefs around as his restaurants deliver in every way."

"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Veronica B.","Came here for a fancy date night while on vacation with my husband, and this place did not disappoint. What I can't stress enough is that the service is absolutely AMAZING. It's probably the best service I've ever received in a restaurant ever. Period. Hands down. Our server could've recited the entire menu from memory, never needed to write our orders down, was able to suggest pairings of drinks, appetizers, and desserts, and had everything timed perfectly, so we could enjoy the pace of the meal. What an experience.
The inside space is small (definitely make a reservation if you can), but it has elegant, yet homey vibes, with cozy lighting and decoration to keep the atmosphere perfect for a date night, but appropriate for a business dinner. The drink menu is exquisite, with some of the most unique cocktail combinations ever. All that I tried were delicious.
The portions are small - the menu is clearly meant to sample and share, but if you're bold and looking to try what's available, this place is an absolute must. It's also in a great location, with surprisingly easy parking, and some of the most flavorful and delicious bites I had on my entire trip."

I decided to visit here last night with my friend, and once again the food and service was fantastic!
We were seated at the bar after calling with a 10 min notice and was accommodated. The host was very polite and sat us at our seats while introducing us to the bartender who was friendly and kind. The bartender walked us through the different drinking options. It was great that he offered to even surprise us if we were in the mood to try something new. We told him that we were open to trying something new and he asked what kind of alcohol base we enjoy and if we preferred more alcohol or fruity tastes. It was entertaining to watch him create the drinks and put them together. He explained the drinks to us and they tasted amazing!
We then ordered the broccoli, polenta fritters (my favorite!), the bread, the mushroom gnocchi and chocolate budino. The menu had recently changed so the pasta and dessert were great surprises!

And yes, make a reservation. The restaurant is small and has a great reputation so if you want to guarantee your dining experience here, plan ahead.
Started out with drinks from a collection of original cocktails. I had to try the Professor Burgess as that's my family's surname and it was perfect.
The food was spectacular. Polenta fritters over ricotta, a beet salad with crumbles of cheese and my personal favorite, bruschetta with mushrooms. The pork belly over grits was perfectly cooked and moist. I recommend the ravioli as well.
We did our best not to lick the plates clean and to keep our groans of delight as soft as possible but I'm pretty sure we still managed to make a scene. Now I'm making plans to return and try all new dishes."

The service was excellent and the ambiance was also great! It's a quaint restaurant and perfect for date night! The black cod, gnocchi, and smoked cod potatoes were delicious!! The only item that we weren't too impressed with was the hamachi crudo as it didn't taste very fresh. I love raw fish (sushi, sashimi, etc.) but this had a funny/fishy aftertaste.

"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dani T.","Delicious food, excellent service. Not much more to say than that.
Sourdough bread - 5/5
Comes with honey butter and roasted garlic in balsamic and olive oil. Absolutely delightful and must get for $2/person.
Beef carpaccio - 5/5
Great balance in this dish between the beef, greens, and mushrooms. Every bite was full of flavor and interesting texture.
Spaghetti Bolognese - 5/5
We had a late dinner so they actually ran out of the tagliatelle and kindly asked me if they could sub in spaghetti instead. The Bolognese sauce had such a great kick to it and the spaghetti was perfectly al dente. I'd come back to just eat this.
Sage Ravioli with pancetta - 4/5
Very flavorful! Actually it wasn't what we expected on first bite, but quickly grew to love it. Ended up using some of the sourdough to soak up all of the sauce to not let the leftover go to waste!
Service was efficient and thoughtful throughout. There are multiple places where they explain the automatic 20% surcharge attached so you're not caught off guard."
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tanya H.","I'd heard so many great things about this place and we finally got around to trying it.
The dining room is a bit like a sauna...in that it's all wood-panelled with very little art or other decor. It was cosy and cool...not that many covers which is why it's probably hard to get a table.
Start off with the sourdough bread. So yummy and I loved the fennel-honey butter it came with.
We then shared the red beet salad and the burrata. Both were very well-executed dishes with generous portions of beets and burrata, respectively. The burrata would probably be a little better served with bread rather than the crackers they provide. I then a chevre/nettle ravioli which was excellent.
Definitely go feeling hungry as you will definitely be full at the end. It's not cheap but not crazy expensive either and it's always great to have well-executed food."

Rainbow carrots, fennel crab salad and tomato salad. Every single one of them is so tasty and we absolutely loved every bit of it.

Love Vendemmia in Madrona, will have to make an effort to score a reservation to Raccolto in West Seattle though. But then, enjoyed Il Nido over in Alki Point/West Seattle by Chef Easton of Il Corvo fame.

"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Maryline W.","Despicable experience. Made reservations ahead. Arrived and were welcomed as if it was a surprise borderline inconvenient. The first draw back is the noise. It was so loud we couldn't have a basic face to face conversation. We proceeded to order wine from our charismatic friendly waiter. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. It took 90 minutes! 90 minutes to get a cold fennel crab flake salad. Still wonder if the crab was just a garnish on the menu to appease novice critics. The second appetizer never came and by the time we got our pasta dish we had been seated for 2 hours.
We could have left, mind you. Complained even. BUT this was Saturday night. The only break we get from our 50h+ shifts/week. We just wanted to remain positive and make the best of our special evening. The manager we suspect generated a form of apology when he delivered the bill because they overcharged us for food we never received and the ""wonky"" Saturday they were having. So now not only did I lose 2 hours of my life I can not get back, but I also need to feel bad for an overpriced botched dinner experience too!? How absurd!
Lesson learned: next time. We will order $100 worth of fresh organic local food, have it delivered, fix our own gourmet dinner and swear off dining out for that Seattle's dining has become a complete scam where profit drives the least scrupulous ones and where pride in your work is an art/virtue of the past."

The ambience is amazing and the decor was sleek and sophisticated."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Rachel E.","The beef tartare and burrata weeabsolutely delicious! The bread served with both was the perfect compliment.

"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Kamara S.","We all have restaurants that we keep coming back to, even if they are a distance away. Le Messe is that place for me.
My first visit was due to a need for pasta and my experience there did not disappoint. So even though I live in the Eastside, I find ways to come back.
My favorite experience is at the chef's counter where they have special items you can't get anywhere else at the restaurant. That where I went my first time and I fell in love. Probably is the place I had bucatini for the first time.
This trip I did the tasting and I believe I am a better person because of it. This is coming from a person who is not picky but is not the biggest fan of someone else choosing their food options. But at least they were kind enough to ask about my allergies and preferences.
The highlights (there weren't any lowlights but these stood out to me:
The zucchini salad and the bread dish was so good, I forgot to take pictures of them .
The steak as the meat course was fantastic. The
The cooked salmon was by far one of the best dishes I ever had. Not only because I could cut the fish with my fork, but because of that skin. It was the right level of crispy goodness that I was heartbroken when I finished it.
And the pasta was fantastic of course. And it was made better by the great service.
Caveat: You can not rely on the website to see what the current offerings are. Which means the items are made fresh, but don't have your heart set on the something you saw on their site as there are not up to date.
But with the food I had, I wasn't definitely wasn't disappointed. Though I wish they were on the Eastside"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Marina G.","Today was my second time here and it completely affirmed my belief that Le Messe is the best restaurant in Seattle. Everything is perfect. The dishes have immense depth and flavor while also being simple and intuitive. Many kudos to the chef. The wine selection is great, the deserts are great. And the service is amazing! Great energy, our server understood when we needed something and when we didn't. I can't remember his name but I would come back just for his welcoming personality. 110% worth every penny. Next time you want to celebrate or just have a delightful night out, do yourself a favor and go to Le Messe"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Candace H.","I had a wonderful experience at Le Messe for Seattle restaurant week. Their interior is simple and beautiful. Definitely looks like a fancy restaurant, they have a high table area that surrounds their kitchen so you could choose to sit there and watch them cook. We didn't do that since we were a group of four and that would've been hard to have a conversation.
They do an AMAZING Beef Tartare. This is a must get item; the bread that the tartare is on top of comes warmed and toasty and the flavor of the beef is spot on. I think it was my favorite of the night!
Their smoked fish is also super good, comes on warm toasted bread as well and I would highly recommend trying it.
Other than that, we had their grilled halibut and pork. Their proteins are cooked to perfection as well with wonderful components to their dish that provides great textures and flavors.
They didn't have any pasta on their SRW menu but I hope to come back to try them because it all looks amazing!
We tried their dessert and we were at first skeptical of the triple cheese dessert but the honey and cheese and almonds was a surprisingly wonderful mix! They had homemade gelato as well and that was delicious! Their chocolate mousse was my favorite, it came with candied orange and flaky sea salt on the top. So creamy and smooth and chocolatey :p
Our server was very helpful and patient with us as we kept talking and forgot to look at the menu at the beginning!"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Clint W.","Wow. We had a great dinner.
The veggies with the crab was bright, citrusy and spot on. Short ribs were super tender and just wonderfully put together. I actually thought the pasta was the dish I liked least, and it was merely good.
Le Messe is a little more difficult for me to get to, but I will be a repeater here. I'm a big fan of Vendemmia, but I really liked Le Messe."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Victoria S.","rarely do I give five stars ratings but this place deserves it. Great location in the lake union Seattle area. Servings are small but didn't lack in taste! They make their pasta right in the restaurant. Menu have French sounding names but let me describe, Dungeness crab pasta is a must try. And the other one is similar to ravioli with taste of a burst of lime, and basil and mushrooms and parmesan cheese and it was excellent. Service was amazing and let your server educate you on what is best and what is on the menu if you are a first timer. Price is fairly reasonable for the ambiance, service and selections. Don't forget to try their dessert menu! We had what they call warm ice cream / yogurt drizzled in pistachios and it was the best!"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Hayley M.","Perfect restaurant! Great food and ambiance. A nice, unique menu. I will certainly be back. Squid ink pasta was delicious."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Sheryl K.","It was the first time trying Le Messe. One of my favorite cuisines is Italian food and pasta, so I was excited to have dinner here.
We ordered the hamachi crudo to start (this was light and refreshing). And for our entree's, we ordered the tagliatelle, which had Dungeness crab, creme fraiche, celery, and chives. And also the bucatini, with chanterelle, oregano, parmigiano, and egg yolk. Unfortunately I couldn't try the tagliatelle because I'm allergic to crab. But my bucatini was pretty tasty. The egg yolk definitely makes all the difference in making the dish creamy and rich. It's one of my favorite Italian dishes to have. We also ordered some bread, which was $5.
The food was pretty good, at least, what I was able to try. But overall, nothing really stood out to me where I would want to return for more.
The service could've been a little better. Our server seemed nice but very robotic. He didn't really come to check on us as often as he probably should've. Didn't really give us any recommendations for both dinner and dessert. He just came to take our order, bring our food, clean our table, and bring our check. Sadly, our dining experience here was just, alright.
If you don't mind dry service, I would at least check out the food here. We might've ordered things that weren't their specialty/popular. But for us, the food wasn't bad; it just wasn't amazing."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Thao N.","I'm not an expert in Italian food, came here for a birthday party because we need a nice restaurant for an excuse to dress up. Our party was 18 people deep, the bill was about $600 total after tax and tip, so for about $30 a head, it wasn't a bad experience. The menu changes every day depending on what they have that day. The entrees here were one of those smaller portion, artistic dishes, pleasing for the eye to look at type of deal. It's pasta so after so many pasta dishes, it does fill you up. My favorite was the agnolotti, it had the best flavor and I love mushrooms in general.
The restaurant is medium size, but spacious with the option to sit at the chef's table where you can watch them cook. They are only open for dinner 5-10pm daily. Perfect for date nights, girls night out, or business dinner. Located at a corner, parking was easy enough during this hour, but then again I did got a parking ticket since after a certain time you have to have a permit, but that's my fault for not reading signs right.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth L.","Tasty handmade pasta with excellent service. Excellent happy hour menu features a trio of house pastas including the squid ink pasta, agnoletti (special) and rigatoni. Rigatoni was outstanding, highly recommend. Squid ink spaghetti was ok - al dente pasta, but dish needed more kick and flavor. Happy hour oysters are $2 each. Drink menu has decent cocktails - will be back for tasty pasta and awesome service!"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Marc L.","Really enjoyed my meal here. I'd heard good things about their pasta offerings as well as their roasted chicken. I sampled the bucatini with braised pork shank and the chicken accordingly. The bucatini was decadent, perfectly al dente, and contained some red onions which really cut the fattiness of the pork nicely. The chicken was also excellent, the crispy skin was complemented beautifully by a rich parsnip celery puree. My server was also very attentive without being overbearing. Definitely want to come back to try more of their pasta offerings and small plates!"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Linh L.","An airy, light-filled, Italian restaurant.
Everything was ordered from their Happy Hour menu (daily 5-6p & 9-10p, bar only).
For starters, we had a dozen of their daily oysters, which were the Purple Mountains from Hood Canals. We also ordered the Ahi Crudo, Springs Greens, and Beef Tartare. The ahi crudo was delicious, with a fresh citrus taste and a good sprinkle of coarse salt. I also loved the spring greens which came with a huge mound of parmesea, so good. The tartare was okay and only came out with three pieces of small toast.
For mains, we ordered the daily fish (Halibut), daily steak (Snake River Zabuton), and the Squid Ink Spaghetti. The fish was delicate and delicious, cooked perfectly. The steak came out medium-rare, with more emphasis on rare. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these dishes. However, I thought the squid ink spaghetti was lackluster and under-seasoned. We did not order it with the extra bottarga (salted, cured fish roe). In hindsight we definitely should have but since our waiter did not mention anything about it. On a positive note, there was a lot of spaghetti.
Overall, I liked most of these dishes. I did notice that the portions seemed small (particularly for the tartare and daily steak, which had 4 slices). Maybe since all dishes were from the HH menu. The service was also just okay."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Matthew L.","Have been here twice. First time, last summer, was great. Happy hour menu restaurant and ambience was perfect.
Came back last night to celebrate a birthday and had just an odd, expeexperience. Restaurant was 4/5 empty. They sat us in the bar area which we wanted so we could do happy hour menu. What's too bad is they have this super aggressive outdoor lighting that shines like a flashlight on the tables in that area and is pretty much an ambience killer. So we asked if we could sit anywhere else. Server was frankly a little rude and then moved us over to another seat about 5 feet away. Then he took the happy hour menus away and said he couldn't serve those to us since we had left the bar area. Sorry but... why are you making this awful guest experience ... I suggested that felt a little silly and the answer I got back was ""I don't control this I'm just a server"".
Which of course sucks for everyone.
Food was delicious that's not the issue. They could not have been nicer to our daughter.
The issue seems to be with the owners who have apparently disempowered their teams from being customer centric. I felt a little bad for the servers. Which are all the wrong emotions to be having when you're out for a nice night!
Also music - not sure why but it was some top 40 crap. Seattle restaurants HAVE to please up their music game. I spend $200+ on dinner to be inspired.
Just a bummer for a restaurant we really want to love!"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Terri W.","Went to Le Messe last night; four of us ordered the Four-Course Tasting Menu. Here's the rundown of what we got:
App 1. Beets w/oil-cured olives and Marcona almonds in a vinaigrette: Very tasty.
App 2. Hamachi Crudo (Hamachi fish, served raw) with shaved kumquat, chilis, and celery: Good, but a bit too mild in flavor.
App 3. Fresh mozzarella slices topped with some kind of chunky orange-red sauce (not sure what it was): this was my least favorite dish -- pretty blah, under-salted, and the flavor and appearance of the orangey-red stuff on top of the cheese was utterly unidentifiable; the only thing I could identify were some mustard seeds. I didn't care for this dish much.
App 4. Delicata Squash with Rapini and black olive: the squash was delicious, but the rapini was pretty bitter, even for rapini.
App 5. Salad of leaf lettuce with candied pecans, freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic vinaigrette. Very tasty.
Pasta 1. Cacio e Pepe Pasta (rigatoni w/cheese and pepper) with actual/real white truffle (not ""truffle oil""): Very delicious! Given that (I believe) they make their pasta fresh every day, I expected a more delicately-textured pasta. It was a little on the thicker, sturdier side, which wasn't a bad thing - it's just that I wasn't expecting that. However, it was fully cooked, yet remained al dente. I actually liked the chewier texture. The sauce is made of Pecorino Romano and black pepper -- with the added bonus of white truffle -- and served with more grated cheese on top - yummy!!!
Pasta 2. Agnolotti (a stuffed pasta) that was filled with short rib, served with Delicta squash and either hazelnuts or Marcona almonds. Very delicious.
Protein 1. Sea Scallops, with parsnip-and-celery root puree, and fried parsnip chips, in Salmoriglio (a Southern Italian condiment made of lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, chopped oregano and parsley, salt, and pepper). Good, but not great in my opinion. The scallops seemed to be properly cooked, with a good sear on at least one side, but it seemed under-seasoned, and something in the dish tasted a little bitter.
Protein 2. Short Ribs. I loved them, but I'm very partial to short ribs, so I may not be very objective. Everyone seemed to like them, but maybe not as much as I did.
Dessert 1. Chocolate Brownie, with sea salt, whipped cream, almonds, and a raspberry sauce: Good; the sea salt made it better.
Dessert 2. Mascarpone Cake with roasted (or poached?) plums and whipped cream. Good.
It's a small restaurant, but when we got there (5:30) it was still fairly empty, so it wasn't noisy. However, a large group that arrived a little later was seated next to us, and they were very noisy. The décor is all hard surfaces, so it was very loud. This is a downside, in my opinion.
Also, we were there for a long time - over 3 hours. So, the hard bench seat we were sitting on was getting pretty hard by then, if you know what I mean. Fortunately, we didn't get any dirty looks or vibes indicating that we really needed to move along, and I appreciate that. (I was keeping an eye on the host station to see if people were waiting to be seated, and I never saw that happen, so I guess we lucked out.)
When we're in the mood for pasta, we'll put this place on our list of options, so we may well come back some time. But I'm not feeling that ""I've just GOT to come back again for sure!"" In other words, we all enjoyed our food (every dish went back to the kitchen completely empty) and we were satisfied with our experience, but it didn't send me over the moon."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Allie M.","Been here twice now - for regular menu once and the tasting menu as well. Each time the food has been absolutely amazing. Haven't eaten anything bad here. On the regular menu during the fall, we had some foie gras mousse which may gave been one of the best things I have ever eaten. The crab tagliatelle is a close second. At the tasting menu, everything down to the salads, the pastas, pork and homemade gelato were perfection. So much food and well worth the price per person for what you get. This might be my favorite restaurant in Seattle."
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa Y.","Had a bad experience at the restaurant tonight.
It was our daughter's birthday today so I called the restaurant and asked them if we can bring a birthday cake. The guy who answered the phone said sure, bring it in.
He never informed us about the cake fee and later we were charged $12 for cutting us 3 pieces of cake. It is ok if you want to charge $4 for cutting every piece of cake, but you should at least store the cake properly.
But no, our nice chocolate mousse cake from Regent bakery was pretty much melted and ruined when the server brought it up. None of the other nice restaurants in Seattle make mistakes and ruin important occasions like this.
Extremely disappointed!"
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tenzin D.","Had a reservation here the other night with my boyfriend. Came in and waited 30 minutes, which was expected since they were a full house and every seat was packed. I loved the liveliness and atmosphere of the restaurant. Beautiful theme and lighting!
Friendly waitress who accommodated us
throughout the night and had wonderful conversations that seemed genuine!
We started off with bakery bread which tasted delicious and light but not as fresh as I'd wish it would've been but should've been expected. Would've been nice touch to have some warmed bread. We also ordered the arancino which was really delicious especially the mozzarella in the middle of it. Wonderful touch!
For entrees, we ordered spaghetti with meatball and the popular Squid Ink spaghetti. Both entrees were spectacular and left me full. I personally enjoyed the meatballs on the spaghetti, definitely a unique taste to a classic staple. Squid Ink was delicious has well but nothing too out of the ordinary, just the idea that it was black noodles. The flavor profile is wonderful however.
Will come back again!"
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kendra W.","Come for the cocktails, the wine and the incredible deserts! These can't be missed in this cute, rustic, local eatery in the heart of Columbia City. The rest, well, good luck!
First- get an early reservations. If you get a reservation after 7pm you will likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for the prior table to finish their meal as guests tend to linger and the service is on island time.
The salads are good, the veggies they use are very fresh. The entree's were forgettable, if not offensive. I had the pork entree and it was reminiscent of a Hungry Man Chicken Fried Steak, at $34, you can see how I might be a tad underwhelmed and even offended. My dinner date stated his meat dish tasted like a fancy Hamburger Helper. Another diner in our group had the squid pasta, which must be for an acquired taste as no one in our group was a fan.
I would come back for the wine, the cocktails and the can't be missed deserts as long as I had a reservation that began before 6pm to be sure I could be seated in a timely manner. For dinner, I guess it's an acquired taste, but we weren't digging it."
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Claudia C.","We have been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got our chance last week. We had a late dinner reservation but decided to stop in earlier for a drink and small bite before catching the movie across the street: I don't give reviews much, but i just had to after such a special, wonderful experience. The staff was so friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The menu was not huge, but had varied choices. We all ordered something different so that we could sample various dishes. They were all so fantastic and tasty! Another plus is that this restaurant has a cute and cozy ambiance. We all agreed that we will definitely be paying another visit soon and encourage you to do so as well!"

"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carolyn J.","La Medusa came with it! Dinner was amazing for us! The food , ambiance and service was top notch.
La Medusa is a quaint staple in the neighborhood. Weekends are hard to get a table but worth getting on the list or make a reservation.
The food is simply delicious. We had the aracini and beets to start, so good. We ate them too fast. The bread , I assume is from Columbia City next door, you get a variety of their delicious breads.
We had two pastas, the spaghetti and meatballs , wow! Simple fresh marinara sauce and unforgettable large meatballs. The meatballs is tops , tender and full of flavor and not salty, I asked the server what the recipe is for the meatballs and of course she smiled and wouldn't tell me.
We had the squid ink spaghetti vongole , so good again subtle flavors , perfect clams.
We had our third course of the veal shank and polenta. We did not leave anything , plate empty! We like to compare how veal shank is prepared when we travel so La Medusa is succulent and tender and not salty like some I have had.
The dessert course is never to be missed at La Medusa , Pana Cotta is exceptional, we had the chamomile and honey water one, omg we wanted another. We also had the pistachio cannoli , you have to ask why aren't they bigger?!
The bottle of Italian Valpolicella was perfect with everything we ate, so order a bottle and relax and eat some good food!"

It's been awhile since I've eaten here and I was not disappointed with my decision. Immediately when we entered the restaurant, we were met with a warm greeting like we were at a friend's home. Jackson, our server, was amazing!! He suggested the best wines to pair with our dishes. The food was superb. The rigatoni was full of flavor. The squid ink pasta was delicious with a generous amount of clams. The chocolate espresso torte was divine! Jackson was even kind enough to snap a photo of us on date night.

All this time I can see him just standing there? Decides to bring us wine glasses but no wine! Another 10 goes by he brings the wine. Took our order, food came out slowly, never checked back, except for the bus boy! We had to ask him again to ask that waiter to come over!

My fiancé and I finally decided to come here and we were very underwhelmed. We looked at the menu and were exited to taste the pasta and primi items. We got the anchovies with raspberries and tiny flowers, the anchovies were good but a bit acidic. Then we had the Arancini but it was a big chungus so it wasn't cooked properly. We had the rigatoni with broccoli which was flavorless and under salted. The spaghetti Nero was the best dish of the night. It was a bit over salted but the clams made up for that. Boo ya Madison OUT"
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Prajna T.","The food at this place is excellent, and anyone who is not particular about waiting way too long for dinner should defiantly check it out. We had a risotto and vegetable appetizers - steak, pasta and tuna entrees for dinner. While the steak was under cooked, the flavors and quality were all great. Panna cotta and chocolate cake for desert were divine.
My only complaint is with how long the food took to come out (at least 45 mins from ordering). I actually thought the kitchen staff might have walked out, and there was not good communication or really any sort of acknowledgment of the delay by the staff.
I had been to this place a few years ago, and will defiantly check it out again, but won't rush back as I can't take the risk of waiting like this again.
Barring service issues, this could definitely be a 4/5 star place."
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Laura D.","Amazing food and service! Upscale rustic might be a good way to describe their menu. Quality ingredients put together in a slightly unexpected way that satisfies. And I am not a big dessert person, but if they have ricotta cake, GET IT!

"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joanna C.","I agree with all the great ratings that are shared. All in all they describe the La Medusa well. However, this Tuesday we found the noise level so high that conversation was difficult among 4 people. In the past this was not an issue that we noticed, and we will likely give it on more chance. Since dinner conversation is important part of the ambiance for us, if it persists, we will likely not return."

"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Robert B.","Very good, well-established Italian restaurant in the hip and getting hipper Columbia City neighborhood...
THE ROSES: Food is quite good, with what appears to be a rapidly-rotating menu (no printed menus; current offerings are in a blackboard on the wall. Dishes are well executed, and service is quite good. Fun location with good view of the local scene. Upscale but friendly and unpretentious clientele makes for great people-watching.
THE THORNS: Even on a weeknight, parking is quite difficult in this neighborhood. Not as bad as Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, or Fremont, but no picnic. While having no printed menu and just relying on a chalkboard saves money, it's kind of a pain for those seated at far tables or with their backs to the board. Some dishes (fish soup) could be a little more aggressively seasoned. A little on the spendy side for what you're getting, especially the wines (nothing under $10/glass - they really need to offer a simple 'vin ordinaire' to compliment the rustic ambiance and menu).
THE VERDICT: This neighborhood institution's culinary offerings make it a real Seattle 'destination restaurant' as well. While a little spendy, it is a definite standout in Seattle's crowded Italian restaurant market. Recommend."
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jamie N.","I want to start off by saying my girlfriend and I have both been in the service industry for almost 10 years, so we have seen some sh*t. We are not the typical snobs to write negative reviews on a place just because the food was under salted. That being said, this was hands down the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. We made an anniversary reservation a week in advance, stoked to try this friken pasta. We arrived at 7:30, and our table was not ready. We waited an additional 15 minutes to be seated at a table (that wasn't so great to be honest) and ordered drinks. Drinks took about 20 minutes to come out. By then we were a little annoyed but still, we are pretty easy to please and understanding (industry gals), and they were busy for a Tuesday night.
All right y'all this is where it gets fun. Our server takes our FULL ORDER, complimenting us on what we've chosen. Tables around us get sat, we ask for a wine list.. Tables around us get food... We're still waiting on our wine list.
Finally, we get a list.. select a bottle. 15 mins go by we get our bottle... we're drinking a whiiiiiiiiile..
and then,
OUR SERVER ASKS IF WE ARE READY TO ORDER DINNER. I'm sorry, what? We've already been waiting over an hour for our apps. Said server asks us to repeat what we initially ordered. Chef comes out and apologizes.. it never got put in. They didn't put in the dang order. What the H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! At this point, we're about to break up with each other after six long years cause we're hangry. Our relationship has lasted so many ups and downs but not this got dang service y'all. So we leave, our drinks comped (duh) and will probably never come back. Go to McDonald's, you'll honestly get better service.
I wish I could rate the food but we never got it so damn. Oh well...."

Came here for dinner on Friday with one of my best friends and here I was telling her I didn't want to eat and I ended up eating everything she ordered. The restaurant was fully booked when I arrived but my friend somehow manage to get us these cute little window seating off to the side. It was weird at first but I ended up loving our seating because we pretty much sat in the corner people watching out these gigantic windows.
We started off with some bread and olive oil then ordered the burrata with a caprese salad, saffron risotto croquette, and we finished with the squid ink spaghetti. Everything was delicious! I was thinking I'd have just a nibble ended up eating everything haha.
The burrata that we ordered with the caprese salad was really light and when you had it with the tomatoes, ugh so much yes! I honestly hate tomatoes but I have never said no to a good caprese salad haha. The risotto that my friend ordered was also fricken delicious. I remember is have that somewhere else and it didn't taste as good as the one at Le medusa. The way they served it was super cute also. I don't know what I was expecting from the squid ink spaghetti. I kept thinking it was going to be served with tomato based sauce and was surprise when it came out without it. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish, a tad bit salty but if I wasn't so full better believe I would have finished it.
We never have left overs when I dine out with my friend so imagine our surprised when we were trying to get the other person to take the last bit of spaghetti home. Either way, I'm really glad we decided to have dinner here. I most definitely want to come back and try other yummy dishes."

The immediate attention by sou chef Walker and host Jackson saved my life. The care received from this staff was absolutely incredible. Walker, Jackson, server Julie and fellow diners continued to check on me. Chef made a special broth for me and Walker gave me a panna cotta and pasta dish to take home. A fellow diner was a doctor who spent a long time with me dispensing valuable advice about what to do going forward. I was overwhelmed with gratitude around the care I got last night from the staff and fellow diners. Sadly I could not eat the short ribs I had ordered but my fellow diner was in heaven with hers!"

Hands down the second best pizza I've ever had after Sorbillo in Naples. Happy to find quality Italian food in Fremont. Highly recommend a bottle from the natural wine selection. Hadn't drank a bottle of wine without feeling it the next day, until this fine day. Have plans to get back here asap."
"In Bocca Al Lupo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/in-bocca-al-lupo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jiwon C.","I really wanted to like it because of the good atmosphere and great location.
Food is under proportioned, overpriced, and tastes like very generic grocery store condiments are used. Our antipasto and pizza had a solid 30 minutes in between being served to us- takes way too long to be placed on our table.
The pizza was underflavored, undercooked yet overcooked in some parts, and very small? My party and I utilized the chili oil and chili flakes a little too much.
It also took our party several tries to get the server's attention to get the check. We were really polite the entire time and there was maybe one other party in the restaurant.
Out of everything the Saute di Vongole (Hama Hama mailla clams oven roasted in white wine) were probably the best."
"In Bocca Al Lupo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/in-bocca-al-lupo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brian C.","I would give this place 5 stars for the quality but for the egregious prices of the pasta dishes, I have to take off a star for that kind of abuse on my wallet.
I went with a friend for happy hour and we ordered two happy hour pizzas. We thought they were a fair price for the size we got. Since the happy hour pizza wasn't enough for a substantial meal, we ordered the lasagna. When the waitress brought the dish, it was so tiny that I thought it was a happy hour portion even though it wasn't on the happy hour menu. Turns out that it was the regular dinner size lasagna for $16. It didn't come with a side of vegetables or even a slice of bread. For a small bar/restaurant, this crazy price was definitely a big surprise. But my friend and I both agreed that the pizza and the lasagna were good.
If you come in for the pizza that this place is known for, you'll walk away happy. Just don't get the ridiculously small size lasagna (other pastas on the menu are probably the same tiny portion) or your Italian grandma will be sad that you spent all that money and didn't get enough to eat."

That said, I've found their pizzas to be inconsistent. Sometimes too charred, occasionally with a bit of ash from the wood fire, and they tend to under-top the pizzas. For instance, the Chanterelle Bianco I ordered had about one mushroom per slice, and parts of the slices had no toppings whatsoever, not even a bit of olive oil base).
That said, you usually can't go wrong with their Pepperoni pizza."

They were formally Via Tribunali, but this was the only Via Trib location we liked. My New York friends approve of their pizza and cannolis. We were so happy the location became a separate owned entity. Solid service, excellent food. Never disappoints."

We ordered 2 arugula salads and a prosciutto crudo pizza between 2 of us, and a glass of the house red wine. The salad was okay, but it didn't come tossed. It only consisted of arugula, Parmesan, and lemon, with barely any olive oil. Although it was good, we expected that for the $8 we paid for each salad, they would have provided a bit more. We could have easily made the salad at home. I also wished there were entree-sized salad options for the purpose of sharing as an appetizer. In terms of the pizza, it came uncut and we had to cut the hot pizza ourselves with scissors. While it tasted good, we wish there was more cheese and was overall less soggy. The dough was good but the toppings ratio felt off. For what it was, we don't think the pizza was worth the $18.
Overall, the ambience was nice, but food was not worth the price."

However, I was not a fan of the pizzas here. They did mention that their pizzas were meant to be eaten with a knife and fork but the pizzas were so soggy that it wasn't pleasant to eat regardless. I would recommend trying the pastas or calzones because those dishes seemed to be more appetizing!"

Service 4/5
Ambiance 4/5
Overall 4/5
The burrata e pesto was delicious, but I wish they served more bread with it. Also would love an option for truffle oil. 4/5
Their pizza coppalina was the highlight of the meal, all the ingredients stood out, the sauce was a little too sweet, and the pizza dough was too thin to even support itself and resulted in all of the toppings and cheese on the plate. Still the pizza overall was good 4/5.
The lasagna was pretty underwhelming. First off the portion size definitely does not justify the price, especially with the lack of meat it had. The sauce was really sweet again, but the lasagna didn't feel heavy in the stomach. The pasta stood out the most, just wished that there was more meat and cheese. 3/5
A great place for a nice dinner date, definitely would go back to try more."

With several restaurants all within a stone's throw from IBAL, I went in to give it a whirl. I really didn't care much for the former Via Tribunali (receipt still says VT), but decided to place an order for a basic Quattro Formaggi to go. When I finally got around to trying a slice...it was underwhelming. But then pizza flavor profiles are subjective to one's palate, I'm more of the Bar del Corso (Beacon Hill) or Veraci (Ballard, Wedgwood) varieties.
Should have ventured across the street to Fremont Bowl, especially what no line?!
Gave it a try, just not for me."

They have the Guy Fieri symbol out front on their window so I was thinking ""this really must be the best pizza in West Seattle!""- and west seattle has a ton of pizza, but I think I had too high of expectations. I mean it was good, but was it the best? I don't think so.
We did a half mushroom half veggie pizza. It came out fairly quickly considering there was only one guy doing the pizzas. It's cool you can see him make them and use the fire oven and everything. It was like $18 which is a little steep for me considering we easily could have each gotten a pizza for ourselves but I understand.
They do have a house made oil that you can dip your pizza into and that's pretty good and original!"

We each had to try a bite of one another's food because we were all raving about our own. Best spaghetti carbonara I've had, and it was so neat being able to watch the chefs make our food with the open design of the kitchen. It was also a treat having owner and head chef Jacques wait on us himself. It is so evident that he brings such heart and passion every day into his work.

"Pizzeria Credo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-credo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Linnea M.","4th review update, 12/26/19: Better than ever !
Do you think the perfect Italian dish exists? Well it does, here at Credo. I was a little apprehensive at the new menu but holy flying meatballs Jacques has knocked it out of the PARK!! Try the chicken sous vide, it is perfect. It comes with a small side salad and pasta on the same plate, which I questioned until I took a bite of the chicken and realized I wanted a salad too, which had been pre provided. It is absolutely perfectly balanced. The chicken melts in your mouthThis dish is pure culinary genius! No wonder Guy Fieri couldn't stop eating it!i told him to start charging more, because it rivals the best high end Italian (Scarpetta in Las Vegas) I've ever eaten and maybe even surpasses it. Next time this man opens a restaurant it will be in New York and $100+ a plate.
2nd review update: This place has been PACKED since Guy Fieri came here!! Finally getting the attention it deserves, I'm so proud to have this place right in my back yard! Jacques, the owner, is amazing and his drinks and drink recommendations cannot be beat. The cinqo fromaggio is a must try pizza, as well as the Biancoverde.
A tip for all ya lovers of Italian meats - prosciutto can be added to both options above to make an amazingly savory and delicious pizza. Hats off to the new pizza chef, I didn't think this place could get any better, but it has. Pasta dishes I'd recommend especially are the Gnocchi Vodka al a verde, and the linguine Alfredo á la Sophia. My favorite salad here is the Credo Salad - with a unique and refreshing mix of apple, feta and walnuts in amongst the greens it is a must try. My mother prefers the Spring Green Mix, but both are incredible!
Update: Alright, I have to update my review and if I could I would give this place another star yet.
Tonight I had no idea what I wanted to drink and asked for a cocktail recommendation- the waitress sent over Jacques, the owner. He asked what I was in the mood for (something semi sweet and sparkly) and came back with a newly invented cocktail. It was amazing and I had to keep the rest of my table from stealing it after they took a sip. This is the second time he's invented a cocktail on the spot for me and it's been AMAZING. And I'm picky with my drinks! P.S. they're still the best pizza in Seattle. Seriously.
Original review:
Still the best pizza in West Seattle! I've been coming here since it opened. Their drinks are amazing, and the owner told us he used to be a professional bartender after I complimented him on how good they were!
The blueberry mojhito is my favorite signature drink of theirs in season and the Credo cosmo is also delicious.
My favorites here for food are the gnocchi, bianoverde pizza with added prosciutto and the Credo Salad. Their salads are really unique and taste amazing."

A simple pasta (the farfalle arrabiatta is what I ordered), no frills, just sauce, cheese and pasta, was delicious. That's the mark of a good Italian restaurant, in my opinion. If your basics aren't good, I'm not going to bother with the more complicated stuff. Anyway, I'm not sure if it was the manager of the restaurant, but our server pointed us to a man who helped us pair wine with our meal and the whole experience was just great. Highly recommend."

Service was great, attentive but not overbearing which is always refreshing.
The pizzas were delicious, we got the Margherita ($13.95) and the Parma Con Uovo ($17.95). The pizza crust was perfect coming out of their oven and a pretty good size. The four of us were filled up after two slices of pizza and some pasta and splitting a rather large Caesar salad, which was also fantastic.

But... It's a pizzeria right?? So with that my friend and I split the Caprese Salad, Carne con Uovo (egg on her side), as well the Spaghetti Carbonara. Everything was excellent. And although the pasta sauce is thickened with egg, it was the star of the night.

Cute little place on California. I'm real glad I decided to try it.
Not the largest menu but they do offer some pastas. But I came for the wood fired pizza and I wasn't disappointed.
I started with a ceasar salad that was pretty good..the only thing I would add to this would be anchovies, but that's just me.
I ordered the suggested ""meat style"" pie. Plenty of toppings but the star of the show was the crust. This is the crust I love, thinner, hold up well but still has a bit of crunch.
I will say that there was a peculiar flavor (I think from their sausage) that I couldn't really get my head around but it didn't take away from one of the best pizza's I've had since moving to WS. I believe it was the chorizo which in my opinion this pizza didn't need.

They have a really great wine list with a bunch of Italian wines. I am not that familiar with them, but the bottle I had was great. Service was a little slow because they were busy, but good.
The menu is very Italian also. I started with the Formaggi Misti cheese plate. The cheeses were absolutely wonderful and it was a great mix. I particularly loved the hard cheese--but I would have been tempted to order it twice in a night.
For my main course I had the Tortelli Del Capo--which were tortelli stuffed with ricotta and raisins. This was superb, the pasta and cheese tasted super fresh and the rosemary butter source was to die for, just fantastic."

We were interested in the happy hour menu (a little broke from after the holidays) but they didn't end up serving hh on NYE. We were a little disappointed but decided to stay anyways and I'm so glad we did! We ordered this yummy platter as an hors d'oeuvres that had like cheese, eggplant, onion, prosciutto, in this like puffy bread thing, so yummy! And then he got some ravioli with mushroom and I had the sausage. His entree was definitely better than mine but mine was still good. The service was great as well although he was a little push yon us to drink or order more but overall enjoyed it and would come back."

Both the hostess and server were very friendly. The interior looks really nice with all the wood furnishing, and there is even an upper level and outdoor area in the back.
I had the Lasagne Verdi (spinach lasagna noodles layered with ragu bolognese, béchamel and parmigiano reggiano). It was honestly heavenly. At $19, it was just a little on the pricey side but definitely worth it. Unfortunately this place doesn't do complimentary bread, but you can buy some for only $3. We picked the ciabatta, which was a decent choice."
"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Caitlyn S.","Going off of yelp and just the photos I came in for dinner while I was visiting Seattle for the first time to try out the food that looked so good through photos. I was able to make a reservation for a Friday night super easily which was nice! We were sat right when we came in and our server came to ask for drinks but we weren't ready. When we were ready I had a question about the spritz, the server then said he was going to bring me a sample of the liquor I asked for and then my boyfriend asked for a beer but then the server said they were out of stock. When he brought the drinks back I ended up with an already made spritz, and no sample. I tried it out and ended up not liking it so I eventually told the server I wanted to get something else and he took the spritz off the bill, which was much appreciated.
Our appetizers were wonderful with great flavor, but kind of odd presentation with the paper on the board under the prosciutto. We ordered the tortellini di agnello and the gnochetti della fiera and were super excited to get them until they arrived poorly plated and the tortellini was missing multiple fillings inside the pasta itself. The desert was great!!!
Overall I think the restaurant had great potential, but I think it needs to work on the details more so to get the full five stars."
"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","jazmine s.","Last Friday night decided to check this place out even though the reviews were less than stellar. I gotta say I was impressed. Great staff, food (lasagna, egg plant dish and wine) decor and ambience. The only thing that was terrible was the music. It did not fit the atmosphere, they were playing oldies including Mashed Potato song. We'll definitely be back!"
"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Leela S.","I'd walked by Osteria la Spiga on plenty of occasions without ever stopping by. I finally had the chance to dine here recently. Turns out that the restaurant is significantly larger than you'd expect from the outside--once you enter, you're greeted by a rather expansive, high-roofed space that feels simultaneously classy and rustic.
The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group with an advance reservation. They recommended pre-ordering appetizers, so that's what we did (there was a moment of confusion among some folks when food that certainly didn't look complimentary began being placed on the table shortly after we arrived, heh). Both the wine and cocktail lists are solid. I highly recommend the Rhonda if you like negronis--made with Piedmontese gin and Carpano Antica, it was a delicious rendition of one of my favorite cocktails.
I ordered the Tortelli al Porcini as my entree, and really enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for mushrooms, and this dish was all about the mushrooms (including truffle butter!). Portion sizes were solid--a couple of people in the group ended up needing boxes because they couldn't finish (granted, we did order a healthy pile of appetizers). Service was pleasant without being overbearing, and they didn't rush us out as soon as we were done eating--it's nice to be able to linger without cutting off the conversation, especially when the restaurant clearly isn't too busy.
Overall, pretty solid meal! It's a quieter, more traditional Italian food experience than nearby Tavolata. The dishes specifically focus on Northern Italian cuisine, which is something I enjoyed. This is definitely a popular date spot based on other tables that were around us."

The atmosphere is perfect for any celebration or just a night out. The staff are friendly and pay close attention to detail throughout service. The drinks are fantastic and they will even accommodate request. The bread service was delicious along with the Caprese. Next, the Polenta Fritta along with the Gnocchi Al Pomodoro was a great start to the meal followed by fantastic Costata Di Maiale. However, though that is a lot, let's not forget about the delicious Panna Cotta Con Lavanda to complete the meal followed with a delicious desert wine. There is nothing on this menu that you could go wrong with and this place is a must try again and again. Fantastic!"

Situated near/ in(?) Chophouse Row a few friends and I decided to come here for their special. We had reservations upon coming and when we walked in we were immediately seated and greeted. Per usual, the two others that I came here with opted for the same specials that I also ordered because we all have very similar tastes.
Overall the meal was good, flavorful and tasty but we didn't leave completely full... especially since it was a 3-course meal. If I were to ever come back, I think I will need to give the pasta a try. Cheers!"
"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Connie A.","Since it's Seattle Restaurant Week, I decided to try another new location, which this La Spiga is quite conveniently located in Capitol Hill. We made a reservation so we were seated quickly, and our server was attentive as well. I loved that we were seated towards the back of the restaurant where there was plenty of natural light coming from the windows, since I noticed they also had booths that were dark and reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory.
As our server took our order, I noticed a baby spider crawling on my menu, and he quickly took it outside to release it, which I appreciated! For appetizer, I ordered the truffle laced mushroom with a sunny side-up egg with arugula, which tasted fine, no ""wow"" factor, they served that along with pita bread that was brought to the table. As for entrée, my group and I all opted for the fresh fish of the day, which was a charred seared fish (that I cant recall!) but the texture was similar to that of a salmon filet. Portion size for the fish was surprisingly large, which was mostly tasty except for the skin - which was far too salty for my taste. Finally, for dessert, I got tiramisu, which was a bit sweet, but delicious nonetheless.
Throughout the meal, our server continued check in on us and our waters were refilled promptly as well. While I greatly enjoyed their service here, the food left something to be desired. Maybe I'll try their pastas next time!"

"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Leah L.","Went here specifically because of a girl with celiac disease. This place has a ton of gluten free items in the menu and they market themselves as catering to people with gluten allergies. Loved that they have a large variety of gluten free pastas around 7pm. They then told her that they ran out of gluten free pasta. They said ""let me go see what options there are"". In the mean time, everyone else's food came out, there were 6 of us! The waitress walked by and we asked if they had any news and she said she forgot to ask and kept going to the back. One of our party got the last salmon fillet and she graciously gave her her dish. The celiac girl then asked the manager to make sure that the dish was actually gluten free. The manager went to the kitchen and disappeared for a while and came back to say that they were only 95% sure that the salmon was gluten free so it's up to you if you want to eat it. WhATT!!!??? This place advertises that they are a gluten free place! They recommended the salmon dish. Then they came back and said they ran out of salmon!!!! How does that happen!!??
By the time the manager came back to tell her that the dish was only 95% sure not gluten free, everyone was already halfway through their meals, and celiac girl was still sitting waiting. One in the party was very adamant about talking to the manager and when the manager finally came out, he wasn't very concerned about the situation. He offered to comp the pasta that the nice girl ordered as a replacement meal and offered to give the celiac girl a sorbet, which they knew was gluten free. But then the sorbet never came out! This wasn't the only gluten free restaurant on the street. The party could have chosen a multitude of other restaurants. It was a Monday night and they had an all night happy hour, which suggests that Monday's are slow nights. The manager really didn't seem believe the celiac girl, he seemed to think she was just choosing not to eat gluten. Absolutely terrible customer service
In terms of non-gluten free dishes, the pasta dishes were quite good and the tiramisu was delicious.
Unfortunately, the misalignment between marketing and reality was just too jarring for me to come back here."

There are no less than 30 tables open but she asked if I had a reservation. I did not. So she literally seats me in the very back room in a corner by myself. You can see in the pictures. I'm all alone in this room. Then tells me I need to be done by 7:15 so they can take the table back. Honestly. I'm just floored. There is an entire deck off the restaurant with 15 tables and three people out there.
This is embarrassing. I'd rather her just say we can't accommodate you. Horrified."

By the time I was done, I was starving! I hadn't been to this location since our kids were teenagers and I didn't realize that they started serving lunch about a year ago. After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed."

Do yourself a favor and order the Brussels sprouts, garlic cheese bread and a pizza too! Also don't forget a few 22oz beers ;)

The decor of the restaurant is basically your classic Italian restaurant.
The place is also kids friendly. Kids get crayons to draw.
The servers are also really nice and efficient."
"Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/buca-di-beppo-italian-restaurant-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Yuchen Z.","Oh Bucca....how I love thy for your large portions and delicious pastas.
Atmosphere: very old school traditional/stereotypical Italian restaurant with the red & white table cloths and Christmas decor all around. Large pasta sauces every where and pictures of people that have eaten there on the walls.
Food:
Huge portions - they only feed 3 (small) or 5 (large) and there's still plenty for leftovers. I come here with my partner and we get the small, and between the two of us, we can get in a total of 6 meals (so once sit down and 2 times eating the leftovers). But that applied mainly to their Sunday Family Dinners which I think is the best deal. You get garlic bread, salad, sausage, meatballs, and a giant bowl of ziti. We've come here many times for this special and it feeds up halfway through the week. Highly recommend!
+ We've come here for their other pastas as well and I have not been disappointed with their flavors. If you come here just for the pastas, I'd recommend coming with a group because if you order just one dish, there's a lack of variety. That's why some people complain about the prices. It really should be family style.
Overall, I highly recommend Bucca for their Sunday Family Dinners and Half Off Meatball Mondays. Otherwise, if you come here with a large group, it's good to order just a few dishes to share to offset the prices."

Their menu has individual-portion options, but they also have a lot family-style options that's meant to serve a couple of people. We ended up ordering two salads, three pastas, and two tiramisu cakes for dessert. The salad, pasta and garlic bread servings were huge. We probably finished less than half of the food. I like the garlic bread and the tiramasu. The pasta and the salads were alright. Lots of quantity, but average quality. Two of the pastas looked and tasted kind of the same even though one was supposed to be spicy. Overall, a decent option to feed Italian food to large parties."

Please hire safe drivers that won't curse and scream out of their cars while making illegal turns in a buca vehicle. It was absolutely insane.
This is regarding an incident around noon on 5/30/19.
I was in a right turn lane on Howell and Boren turning, when the buca car pulled up next to me (from behind) in the middle no turn lane. Oncoming traffic made it impossible to make the turn for a bit, but seems like she got impatient.
She pulled up and started screaming obscenities, pulled up in the middle of the intersection, illegally blocking, then made an illegal turn while continuing to screech at me.
So angry Seattle driving, just in a buca car and on meth.
Not a great look.
Please sit down and have a conversation with your staff about driving like normal people.
I road rage too--everyone does from time to time. But your drivers endangered people around them, and that driver at noon today should not be driving for you, let alone on the road to begin with.
In terms of food, I did like the pasta month a couple months back. The pappardele was great. But it's not worth supporting a business that endangers peoples lives."

I got the pasta carbonara, and it had fettuccine noodles instead of the regular spaghetti noodles, which I would have preferred. Topped with a copious amount of the Parmesan cheese they left at the table, it was pretty good. I think it's a bit creamier than I'm used to, but if you like that, then this place's carbonara might be your cup of tea.

"Salvatore Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/salvatore-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kimi P.","The food here is good. The dishes are a good size and it was all very tasty.
I did have a weird experience with the waiter though. He sat all three of the groups in the restaurant in a corner by the window. After he gave each of the groups water, he got all of us to quiet down and started presenting the specials to all of us at the same time. They had just a ton of specials though so I could see why he didn't want to repeat himself.
Other than the specials announcement, it started to get a little warm with the sun coming in through the West facing window. If you're here in the summer, maybe ask for a seat away from the window.
Also, the coconut sorbet was served in a coconut shell. It seemed very similar to the specialty brand of ice cream sold in Costco and similar grocery stores. It was just kind of odd.
Still, the pasta was good!"

The food is amazing and you will not be disappointed."
"Salvatore Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/salvatore-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Meg W.","The outside doesn't make this place look particularly inviting, but glad we finally made it in earlier this year. We've been pleased with everything we've tried; the burrata was especially noteworthy, and I've not had tiramisu the proper combo of boozy and earthy chocolate (rather than sickly sweet chocolate) outside of Italy proper.
A recurrent theme in the negative reviews for this place (and at least one other decent restaurant in the area) is about the bread. Here's the deal: Italian bread is not like American bread. It is there to absorb the incredible amount of sauce and good olive oil in your dish; the focus is not on the flavor of the bread itself. No, it's not modern artisanal bread. It's not trying to be, and it doesn't need to be. Don't dig it? Fine. But don't claim you want authentic and then bash it when it actually arrives!"

My picky eater seven year old completely finishes his plain pasta with cheese butter, my daughter is more advantageous and she is willing to try some of mine and still eat her spaghetti. My husband and I check out today's special but we seem to fall back to our favorites . It all delicious and we can't wait to go back."
"Salvatore Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/salvatore-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff N.","Have I mentioned that my Italian side is almost impossible to please when it comes to Italian cuisine? But coming to Salvatore's was a nice change. I finally found a good Italian restaurant that makes solid Italian food that left me completely satisfied.
We ordered several appetizers including two antipasto, arugula salad and a special that was a mozzarella with mascarpone cheese and prosciutto.
The antipasto came with some cheese, salami, mortadella and capicola as well as some Giardiniera salad. I liked that they used hard salami and not the soft variety. The cheese was good but it could have used a few more slices. The capicola was nice and spicy as I like it. The gardenia salad had a mix of carrots, cauliflower, peperoncini peppers, celery and red bell peppers which was in the middle of the plate.
The mozzarella and mascarpone cheese appetizer was simply amazing. The mix of mozzarella to mascarpone was perfect. It was served with four large pieces of prosciutto and sitting on olive oil sprinkled with basil on top. Since there were seven of us we split the prosciutto in half so more people could enjoy it. This was my favorite appetizer by far. This went great with their bread.
The arugula salad had an olive oil and lemon flavor with some fresh cheese on top. It cane with several different types of tomatoes as well. There was a very large amount of salad which was good for our big party.
We ordered the ravioli alla Bolognese, the pasta al forno, spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe, penne ala puttanesca, penne Bolognese and two orders of the veal special. I had a taste of all of the dishes and really thought the ravioli alla Bolgnese, the veal special and the penne ala puttanesca were the best. I thought the penne Bolgnese and the pasta ala forno were both solid dishes but the spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe was way too salty and fishy. I could only eat one fork of it. But everything else was great so I'm still giving this place five stars. My little nephew ate the whole thing and loved it!
The ravioli alla Bolognese was great. The ravioli were cooked perfectly and none of my ravioli were broken. The cheese filling was not watery and there was just the right amount of sauce. It may not look like a lot of food but it was filling. The veal dinner special was served with a side of ziti. The veal was definitely the best thing on the menu! The flavors were balanced perfectly with the use of spices and a bit of wine. The cooked spinach with it also added to the overall appeal of this dish.
The pasta al forno was the lasagne. It was a nice sized serving and it was great to see that it was not watery when brought to the table. The balance of mozzarella and ricotta was spot on. Both the penne alla puttanesca and the pene Bolognese had al dente pasta. The puttanesca had a hint of anchovy in the read sauce. If you like anchovies get this. The one dish I did not like was the spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe. I had one taste of it and felt it was way too fishy with an anchovy overload! None of the adults liked it but my young nephew ate all of it.
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was huge! It tasted wonderful and was very fresh! The chocolate cake with ice cream had very moist cake and it was also a nice size piece of cake. The puff pastry dessert had a nice amount of whipped cream and ice cream. It was very filling!
We also had two bottles of Arcangelo Salice Salentino which was good as was the Peroni of course. We also had espresso and black coffee.
Everything except for one dish was great. My Italian side left very satisfied! If you give this place a try tell them Jeff's Nonna sent you!"

"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tasnim K.","My friend and I ordered from here after I got off my flight from SFO. We had been planning on eating pizza that night for a while, but were stumped as to where we should go. At first, this place seemed an unlikely contender, as the options seemed really limited and we were unsure of how good the pizza would be. However, after much deliberating, we decided to go with Italian Family Pizza and we did not regret it!
We ordered a medium cheese pizza with bell pepper, mushroom, and garlic topping over the phone, and it was ready to pick up in 20 minutes. Soon as we walked in, they had our pizza out and ready, freshly made. The pizza tasted great -- the garlic steeped into the cheese well and the veggies used were freshly baked into the pizza. The crust was also surprisingly good, too. It was both amazing and filling for two hungry girls wanting to stay at home and watch movies! I'd highly recommend this place if you're ever around in the First Hill area in Seattle!"
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tom E.","Delightful, slightly bizarre experience. If you're craving a gooey, spicy, crusty pizza, get the New Yorker. Genuine sausage, perfectly spicy cherry peppers, topped with gooey, creamy Ricotta, thin chewy toasty crust.
The gravelly-voiced server reminded me of a Doonesbury character, and the tableware was completely bright red plastic on an imitation-concrete table. Red cup, red plate, red napkin. I'm not kidding. As if that wasn't bizarre enough, to add to the ambience a sci-fi thriller movie was on in the background, replete with gutteral primordial noises.
But, there's no denying that pizza was incredibly good."
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley M.","This is the best pizza I've found so far in Seattle. The crust is very good, and their selection of pizzas is wide but not excessive. All of the varieties we tried had very fresh ingredients and wonderful flavor. Definitely recommend the margheritta!
Also, the crust is thin so don't be afraid to order a whole small for one person. 3 people can probably share a large if they're hungry
Definitely coming back for some more !"
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike O.","This was my favorite pizza place in Seattle when it was owned by the Calozzlis. I am from philly and this was the first really good pizza in Seattle. I was one his regular customers on First ave then it moved to first hill and then i was sold in 2018. Went back with some friends and it wasn't the same pizza. Crust was thin in middle but thicker in the middle and like french bread on the end. The sauce used to be wonderful and flavorful and now its just from the can. Its ok pizza but not worth driving across town and finding parking on first hill."

Thinking it was just really busy with both take out and in-service, we finally inquired about the status of our pizza after 30-40 minutes. Come to find out that our order was never processed! Really bad customer service as no one came over to check on us. And the pizza was okay but not worth the wait."
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brian B.","In my all-time top 3% of pizzas! That's nearly 40 years of pizza eating including a score of US territories, 3 foreign countries and 2 continents people!
The crust is so good I would literally eat it on its own as a plain baked flatbread. Soft, billowy, pulls apart like the gossamer feathers of angel wings! Flavors subtle and fresh. With toppings, the pizza has an excellent chew.
Tomato sauce is zesty and bright. Toppings are plentiful and perfectly balanced. They do add large lumps fresh ricotta to some of their pies. I'm not a huge fan usually but I loved it; you can break off the end crust and dip it in ricotta which was a fun way to devour a slice.
Pizzas are expensive but GIGANTIC. We plunked down $40 for the biggest pie and got stares all the way back to the hotel. It fed two adults and two young kids dinner and the next day's lunch."

"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yoon Hee C.","I was having a hard time finding a good NY style pizza ever since leaving the Big Apple, but I think this place will help fill that void. Their pizza is ginormous without compromising the taste and it was one of the best thin crust pizza I've had in a long time (we had the New Yorker plus mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes). The pizza crust is made from a moist, chewy but not too chewy, dough and they seem to use high quality cheese. Their ricotta cheese was silky and creamy (aka absolutely delicious). They ain't cheap! But will definitely come back for more. :)
p.s. Oh yes, the meatballs and lasagna. Don't forget to get those."
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","John N.","I am from the northeast (NY/NJ), and believe me when I say that it is darn near impossible to find great pizza elsewhere in the country (that nonsense in the Midwest doesn't qualify as ""pizza,"" though that's a separate discussion ). Italian Family Pizza comes close. I had the New Yorker 12"" (see pic). For the portion size, it was perfect. The sauce was notably fresh (not canned), the cheese to sauce ratio was spot on, and the dough was crispy on the bottom and soft but not soggy on top (i.e. not overdone). The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt the overall value wasn't 100% there. My bill was $20 (inc. tip). That's a bit steep for a single serving pizza. The large is $40! I get that it's Seattle, but you have to keep things in context. It's pizza, not truffles and caviar."
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Peter C.","If I'm having pizza for lunch, my favorite way to do it is to have pizza and salad. Italian Family Pizza doesn't serve slices, but that just means you can go with a friend & split 2 things! The small pizza is plenty for 2 to share, and the salad is good. Definitely not a boring plate of greens. My friend very wisely asked for dressing on the side, and that was a pro move. The dressing is not your typical oil & vinegar. It's slightly spicy and I liked it, but in small amounts, which is why you definitely want it on the side, and drizzle it with a light hand. The pizza is good, and they definitely didn't skimp on the pepperoni (see pic). The only thing I may ask is for the pizza to be a little more well-done in the middle, because it's not sturdy enough to be picked up on its own. You have to support the center with a fork or something, so it's slightly hard to eat. But, a good lunch if you're in the area!"
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sebastian T.","I love pizza, and after hearing that this places serves huge pizzas capable of feeding 3-4 people per pie, I had to see what the commotion was about. The interior is quite large, and it gave off a blend of vibes - authentic pizzeria & chain restaurant in the making. The server gave off a quick & snappy but warm feeling, but it made me feel like it was authentic experience.
The pies were exactly as i expected, they were huge, and I did notice that there was a pizza oven that got hot enough to replicate the semi-burned flavors you'd get on a pizza, but personally i'd recommend to avoid going with getting the HUGE pizza, get multiple smaller ones. The dough was a bit thicker (most probably due to the size of the pie), and the toppings/sauces were very scarce. I'm not one to desire heavily saucy pizzas, but there could definitely been more to give the right balance. I was almost tempted to ask for an extra serving of tomato sauce to pair with my pizza.
Even though the pie was slightly lacking, it was still average/above average, and the novelty of a huge pie can be great for big parties! I'd recommend coming here to try it at least once, I had a pleasant experience, and I'd come back to try their smaller pies!"
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stuart F.","So let me start by saying that I placed my order through Yelp/GrubHub. When the order arrives the driver was carrying the pizza box in his hand, and not in a delivery bag--probably explains the Luke-warm pizza. When we got it to the room we found out that the pizza was made wrong (missing toppings). When i called the restaurant I got attitude from the kid that answere the phone letting me know that I had to take it up with GrubHub since they're the ones who placed and paid for the order. I said, ""but it's your restaurant and your name"". His response, ""so what are you getting at?""
I guess what I'm getting at is you own the customer experience, regardless of what crappy 3rd party delivery service you choose to represent your brand.
Pizza was okay, but would have been better with all the toppings we ordered, not just onions."

"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Patrick S.","Absolutely Delicious! This is the Deal!
Italian Family Pizza is East coast style with thin crust, fresh ingredients, and incredible red sauce.
-The pizza:
After coming here a few times, there really is no way you can go wrong. Whether just ordering a small for 1 or 2 people, or ordering the very large 23"" pizza, any of the options will not disappoint you.
Their sauce and their crust really pair well with any of the vegetable or meat toppings. Personal favorite is the new yorker.
If you want to try something different, their white pie is sauceless, but comes with 3 different cheeses and you can always add toppings to it as well.
-Other menu items:
They have one salad, but it is all you need. It comes with a tangy red pepper dressing, and the salad comes fully loaded with olives, cheese, and pepperoncinis.
The cannolis are made every day and are too good to come from a pizza place.
They also offer pastas, stromboli, and calzones. I have yet to try any of these because the pizzas from this place keep me coming back.
-Service:
The customer service here is always friendly and your food comes out quickly. They will answer your questions if you have any, and are happy to make recommendations.
-Price:
For being in downtown Seattle, (well, first hill), these prices are really good. Especially if you go big and get the large pizza, you will get more than pizza to feed 4-5 people for between $30-$40 which is a great deal especially when you consider the quality!
Note: they do not deliver, but they do carry out, and there are third parties that can deliver if you so wish. However, it is worth going your first time, sitting down at the red-white checkered tables surrounded by brick for the full experience!
Cheers!"

The first experience my hubby wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken, however he did enjoy the salmon dish i ordered, he dislikes fish in general. The flavor combos of the dish were done exquisitely.
This time we tried the pizza. This is our new pizza spot! The fungi pizza was heavenly. I salivate thinking of the burst of truffle oil flavor with every bite.

We ordered:
AL FUNGHI- The size was definitely shareable between the two of us. The flavor was 100% there, everything was really fresh from the mushrooms to cheese, there wasn't too much of anything and it wasn't too greasy which was perfect.
LINGUINE ALLA PUTTANESCA- They knew we were sharing and split the portions in two for us which was great. There was a lot of shrimp even for us to be full even though we shared the pasta. Everything was flavorful but if you're not a fan of olives (like me) make sure to let them know.
CUSTOMER SERVICE- I forgot the names of the two men who helped us out but they both were really sweet, especially since it was thanks giving they made us feel the holiday spirit forsure. 10/10."

The not-so-good:
The changed design. This space used to have the most beautiful designed interior and sensible flow. Now, long tables are inches away from the cozy half-moon booths-- poor design. My companion and I could barely hear each other.
The food was mixed.
We had to request bread-- why??
When it arrived it plain-- sans butter or olive oil.
The apps were good-- the polenta fritters quite tasty.
As were the oysters.
I order the burger & fries. The fries arrived cold.
The bun was mushy-- totally disintegrated into the burger--messy.
Why not a Macrina-- or similar-- roll??
The obligatory 20% service fee-- which is not listed on the menu.

The drinks were pretty strong, but still tasted pretty good. The Hermes was our favorite of the three.
We then ordered the bolognese, carmen pizza, and orfeo salad to share. The salad was really fresh and the dressing tasted really good. The bolognese was pretty good. When the pizza came, they gave us a new york one. While we didn't touch it, our waiter came up and immediately took it away. We were a little confused, but then our carmen pizza came up right away. Between three, we were satisfied with the amount of food we ordered. The pasta and pizza were really hot and fresh and tasted really good. We ordered a tiramisu for dessert. The rum taste was pretty strong, but was still really good.

It came with castelvetrano olives, getable compose (bell peppers, garbonzo beans, etc) and a charred lemon dressing. It is a little more on the expensive side- we ended up paying about $90 for 2 apps, 1 entrée and 2 drinks- the bill did include an automatic 20% tip.

Orfeo was simply perfect! They had just opened. We were the only customers-it was 4pm on a Wednesday! The happy hour price for a tequila grapefruit cocktail was $7, and it matched any$12 craft cocktail. We ordered 3 small plates. The hearth bread with various spreads was great. The bread was fresh out of the wood fired oven and the baked ricotta spread was our favorite.
We didn't catch our server's name, but the receipt noted Team One. Service was attentive.
While we were in the process of paying the check, the hostess or she may have been the manager brought us a complementary box of 4 very fancy doughnuts! Team One had heard us talking about finding ice cream or doughnuts. Turns out that there's a doughnut shop next door. It's owned by the same folks and was closing for the day, so they gifted us doughnuts. It was the perfect end to the day and a launched us into a happy vacation.

You must start with the hearthbread appetizer with spreads and the polenta fritters, trust me.
For the pasta course I always get bolognese (really I order it pretty much anywhere that serves it) but I have tried most of the other pastas and all have been exemplary, esp. the Dungeness crab carbonara.
I've had For entrees I have ordered both the steak and the pork chop and loved them. My tastes of our table's fish and chicken dishes have been great as well.

It was in their separate dining section so it's very private and good for big group dinners! I liked the ambience, you can chose to either dress up or down as I saw both.
My friends ordered the Hearth Bread. This flat bread comes out on a wooden platter with 4 spreads: baked ricotta, baba ghanoush, tapenade, and a whole roasted garlic. As soon as me and my bf saw that, we put in order for another hearth bread for ourselves. However, the server brought out their regular wheat bread. We were confused since we had asked for the hearth bread and really wanted it, but the waitress was able to take it away after the misunderstanding.
All the pasta is made in house, so everything tastes very fresh! I got the spaghetti al granchio ($26), which is just spaghetti with dungeness crab meat. Wished the portion size was just a bit bigger for the hefty price tag, but otherwise the dish was very flavorful. You get a good amount of crab meat as well. My bf got the mahi mahi which he enjoyed very much as well. The roasted potatoes were delicious.
Keep in mind there is a mandatory gratuity of 20% on the meal. Overall it was a nice experience with good service and I wouldn't mind coming here again for their pastas for a special occasion."

LOL We had planned on a different restaurant but when we got there, nothing was available for 2 hours. Whoops. Where to go next? Called a few places and the story was all the same. Finally... a place that could take us. :) We ended up at Orfeo and I'm certain it was meant to be!
Upscale casual, I found Orefeo to be visually appealing. I loved the flow of the very-open, multi-level restaurant...and though I know this isn't a technical term, it was beautifully curvaceous.
Service was well-paced and friendly. Food really hit the spot.
Polenta Fritters were crispy and went well with the marinara.
Orefeo salad - straightforward, fresh, not enough pistachios. :)
Carmen pizza - nice chew to the crust, tasty toppings.
One negative - no complimentary bread for the table. lol We arrived pretty hungry so that stood out to all 5 of us. (Yes, we could have ordered bread.)
Prices were on par for this type of restaurant, in Belltown, and I happily embraced Seattle's automatically added gratuity."
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elaine Y.","Food is phenomenal, but service left some to be desired.
We began our meal with the coal roasted mussels. Wow. Wow. Wow. This was easily one of the best mussel dishes I've ever had the pleasure of consuming! The dish comes with 16 mussels and 2 pieces of thick cut crusty bread. The mussels are so plump and they have this beautiful subtle smoky flavor from the coals that is also bolstered by the garlic, rosemary, lemony sauce. Unfortunately, we didn't have nearly enough bread to clean the dish.
Up next came our entrees which we opted to have family style and without alcohol. Maybe Orfeo isn't accustomed to this because this is where we felt service began to fall off and slow to a grinding halt at some points.
First, for a restaurant aiming for an upscale feel, I almost expect glasses/plates to be topped off/refreshed often, but they weren't. It really would have been nice to eat on something larger than 4"" plates and get refilled on our bottle of water. Plus when the table next to you who is actively drinking glass after glass of wine comments that service is slow....service must be slow.
But back to the food: The linguine with crab meat was very light on the palate. The crab meat was plentiful and the sweet corn and crunchy asparagus paired well with the silky soft freshly made linguine. Unfortunately the chorizo didn't add enough salt which is what this dish really needed to be truly amazing.
The pizza was our attempt to experience the hearth bread and I think it was fairly representative at least on the crust edges. The spicy meatball variety we tried was overall very good though. I liked the additions of onions and artichoke hearts to tie in with the meatballs. The crust is crisp but also has a delicious chewiness to it.
The lamb chops come with 4 fairly large bones. We opted for medium rare but found it to be a little too rare - still ate it though...still enjoyed it too. The balsamic reduction in the potatoes was delicious but the sauteed pea shoots were definitely on the older side and a little difficult to chew through. It was also odd we weren't given a serrated knife.
We finished our meal with the peach crostada topped with ice cream which was amazing! The crust was perfectly crumbly and the peaches were nice and sweet. French vanilla bean ice cream probably would have been more notable but regular vanilla still worked well.
The check took nearly an hour to arrive. We toyed with the idea of going to Columbia Tower after dinner (it was 8:20pm) but we didn't leave Orfeo until past 9. The poor table next to us didn't receive entrees until we were having dessert. Mind you, we entered shortly after them.
Like Steelhead Diner, Orfeo sticks a mandatory gratuity of 20% on the meal...if I was able to allot it, I'd hand every last penny to the cook. Kudos to the kitchen - 100 percent!"
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thao H.","Came here for Seattle Restaurant Week and the food was okay. The service was a little lacking. They gave me a fork to eat with my affogato, which I thought was weird. Who scoops ice cream with a fork?"
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James S.","Went to this place for Valentine's Day and, though a bit corny with balloons and romantic looking decor here and there, it was a pretty good experience overall.
Service - Not great. Quite slow at times, particularly while waiting for our drinks which took 15 mins at least, but it was a busy holiday evening so not terrible all things considered.
Atmosphere - OK. Not much character and gives off a bit of a chain restaurant vibes to be honest.
Food - Good. Highly recommend the hearth bread, which is essentially cheesy bread with delicious dipping sauces (one of which is roasted garlic and is awesome), and the ravioli was solid.
Drinks - Very good actually. Highly recommend the Titan, which is well-balanced and quite booze-forward."
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ruth U.","A neighborhood gem. Fabulous food and service and loved everything we ordered. Had the mushroom pizza as a starter along with the wood fire cooked mussels and the antipasto board. Entrees were the Orfeo burger, swordfish and the pork chop. All cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. We will be back for sure."
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Scott S.","The atmosphere was a bit abrasive when I initially walked in, but was welcomed when I sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Narcissus cocktail to start, which was made well. I ordered the antipasto appetizer to go with it. The antipasto was a bit lackluster. Everything just tasted of olive oil and the cheese didn't seem high quality. I came here because I wanted some pasta carbonara. I was a bit disappointed in their rendition of the dish. It had chorizo and saffron, which turned it into a different type of dish for me. This is not your traditional carbonara. I think I'll plan on trying another Italian restaurant next time."
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julie P.","I've been to Orfeo twice, both for friends' birthday dinners and I've loved it! The overall experience was so good, I highly recommend it for big group dinners!
All of their pasta dishes were unique and delicious! We tried the Tagliatelle Bolognese and the Dungeness Crabmeat Spaghetti and both were so flavorful and superb! The portion size is good enough to share as well.
But my favorite dish of the night was the Charcoal Grilled Octopus Salad. The presentation of the dish was so beautifully crafted and every bite was to die for! I don't even like octopus that much but I would get this appetizer every time. The pizza was good but I prefer the other dishes over pizza.
The food, the service, & the atmosphere were all 5 stars. I will be eating at Orfeo often!
They also have happy hour everyday from 4-6pm!"
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ross C.","Good food but they charge 20% ""service charge"" without letting clients know. Oh and it's 20% of the after tax amount. You don't tip after tax. When we came in we wondered why it was so dead and now we know why. Stay away. Never coming back here that's for sure."
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","J S.","DO YOU WANT TO PAY 20% MORE THAN YOUR FOOD AND BEVERAGE BILL IS? This restaurant tacks on 20% to your bill as a Service Charge!
Four of us went here for happy hour and our bill for food and drinks came to $84.00 plus $8.48 tax equaling $92.48, but then 20% was added to the bill along with sale tax on the 20% ($16.80 + tax $1.70) bringing our total bill to $110.98!!
So, we went from $92.48 to $110.98 because THIS RESTAURANT on its own tacked on a Service Charge and required tax. This is WRONG! We will never go back.
Fortunately for us, a friend noticed the Service Change because the receipt had ""Additional Tip"" printed on it with a line.
Be sure to ask BEFORE you order anything at any restaurant as I understand more and more restaurants may do this."
"IL Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Irika S.","Boyfriend and I came here for my birthday after our previous reservation didn't pan out for an odd reason. Regardless, definitely not disappointed. The food was both plentiful and good, and the waitstaff were very nice about helping us pair wine with our food.
However, just be aware that the lighting is quite dim and this is not a quiet place! Most of the time we couldn't hear the background music and had to elevate our voices a little to talk. It didn't bother me so it won't really affect my rating but it may be an issue for others."
"IL Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nhoj K.","We spend a week end in Seattle at Christmas. A highlight is a dinner at a nice restaraunt that has some character to it. Our favorite place recently closed leaving us in need for a new Saturday night dinner place. Through Yelp, we decided upon il Bistro. Great find, but.....
This is a wonderful setting, at the foot of Post Alley and the Gum Wall and in a classic basement bistro setting. The ambiance was super and just what we like.
The wait staff was friendly and prompt. However the kitchen and bar seemed ""behind"" and so our drinks and meal took a long time (more than casual, elegant dining speed).
I had the gnocchi, my daughter the ciappino. Both very good. In fact, my daughter tried a bite of the gnocchi and said it was the best she ever had!
My wife on the other hand, had the chicken dish and was very unhappey with the chicken itself. The sauce and fagioli were very good but the chicken tastless and ""an odd texture"". It was not on the level of the rest of the dish or our dishes.
We will likely give il Bistro another try as we like the restaraunt, but not for the chicken dish."
"IL Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Don M.","When I'm on vacation I like to find ""famous stuff"": the lounges that the stars used to hang out in - or those places that all the locals rave about. My wife and I were thinking Il Bistro might fit the bill. It's been there for 30 years and It's located just off Post Alley. In fact the back wall is the legendary ""gum wall."" So we were expecting something amazing, maybe even legendary. The Yelp reviews promising an ""underground gem"" really fuelled our expectations too.
Based on the meal we had, I'd have to give it a rating of ""meh."" Certainly not worth $105 - which, with tip converts to $165 Canadian. I expect a memorable, or at least a good meal for that much.
The place was packed, and if you're looking for a quiet rendezvous you might be disappointed - especially if you want to whisper sweet nothings into someone's ear. While it's dimly lit (i.e. you can't read the menu without the decorative candle), cozy (low ceilings) It's louder than a Jr. High classroom the day before the school dance. We actually moved tables trying to escape the frat-party din.
Of course, all of this is minor if the food is actually good. We certainly didn't find anything to rave, or praise even faintly. I had the risotto, which was a cafeteria-style rendering of the dish. The predominant flavour was ""too salty."" Besides cheese and lots of salt, there was no real discernible seasoning, nuanced, layered or otherwise. My wife had linguini al mare - and the title was obviously taken too literally. It was swimming in a seafood ""broth"" best characterized, once again, as salty. I couldn't really taste anything else in the dish to even conjure a guess as to where the chef was going form. While I'm a big fan of ""letting the ingredients speak,"" in this dish they just kind of whisper, or gurgle.
We began our meal with unremarkable starters. A Tuscan bean soup - which, again, mostly just tasted like salt with a definite grocery-store deli vibe. My wife had a watery Caesar salad which, for the first time in our experience, had no garlic in it.
Between us we ate less than half the food. Surprisingly, maybe because they were busy, or perhaps because they're self-satisfied/arrogant, nobody asked, at any point, if we were enjoying our meal. Of course, I don't really think they cared, the service was brusque, cold and indifferent. Maybe we're too Canadian we expect nice.
In hindsight, I guess every city has those bland, over-priced, old school grad-dinner-and-anniversary Italian joints that people's grandparents really seem to love. This place definitely falls under this category."
"IL Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joy S.","IL Bistro is a slightly hidden, tucked away ""underground"" restaurant. It's super easy to miss because it's sandwiched in between the Gum Wall and a graffiti/""art"" plastered wall, both of which are so easy to divert your attention to. Even though it's in the heart of all the tourist traps, it feels like a mostly-locals hangout. In fact, we wouldn't have even found this place if not for a local - and we walked right past it the day before and had no idea we passed by it.
The ambiance here is super romantic - everything is dark and candlelit making it a great date night spot! It was pretty packed but they were able to seat us ""in the bar area"" (not actually at the bar, but a tinier table right by the bar) right away on a Saturday around 8 pm.
We just came for drinks and snacks since we ate earlier. Their drinks + cocktails list was pages and pages but luckily our server was super helpful in choosing drinks to our liking based on our alcohol preferences. Service was great - our server had a great vibe, checked up on us just the right amount, and did her best to personalize everything we ordered so it was just the way we liked it!
We had their Antipasto Misto (selection of salami, imported cheese, marinated vegetables) - aka a meat & cheese plate. On its own it's $16, but we substituted for burrata and added bread so I'm not sure what the total came out to.
It was a really good variety, with about 3-4 cured meats and a bunch of pickled veggies like cauliflower, carrots, olives, cucumbers, bell peppers. I just wish there was more cheese than just the burrata.
Overall IL Bistro was a super cool find and a great way to feel transported elsewhere - sitting here, you totally forget you're in Downtown Seattle!"

I had never in my life tasted something as horrible as that. I will never eat here again in my life. I gave some to my coworker cause he loves smoked salmon and he's not picky at all, and even he thought it was horrible. On top of that the dish cost over 40 bucks. I would never recommend this dish to anyone."

While service and ambiance at il bistro are always wonderful, the food has gone dramatically downhill in the last year or so. On our most recent visit, the pizza came out cold, the pasta was undercooked and the Caesar salad tasted oddly like pickles. Very strange. The visit prior featured burnt pizza and unsalted prawns... it's a smorgasbord of culinary disasters.
Despite that we will probably be back because they're open late, staff is helpful, the bartenders are friendly and the prices are low. If the food was consistent it would be a more regular spot... fingers crossed it picks back up. We will keep the faith until then!"

I was hungry and tired. We walked in to this restaurant out of a cold winter rain with low spirits. We were welcomed heartily by the bartender. Our server Sofia was knowledgeable and fun and explained the history of the amaro. The drinks warmed me up, and the small plates on the happy hour menu were satisfying.

"IL Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle M.","I spent a ridiculous amount of time online reading reviews of restaurants in the city to go to for our anniversary, and nothing was jumping out at me. Cookie cutter everything. I wasn't seeing anything truly special and about threw in the towel and chose one of the usual suspects. Then, I found something about IL Bistro. The name wasn't familiar, so I looked into it a bit more. Little did I know that this was the place I'd walked past for years and years, always curious about the tucked away spot below the market entering post alley. Immediately upon seeing the photos alone, I felt butterflies in my stomach....this was most definitely the place. I booked a reservation immediately. The evening of our dinner, we took a nice stroll through the then closed and quiet Pike Place Market and he was sooo curious about where I had chosen because I kept it a secret. lol We began walking down into post alley and made the first left into this beautiful hideaway. We were immediately greeted by two very polite and funny gentlemen and lead to our table. I'd arranged for their romance package, so as we got closer he was surprised with rose petals and champagne waiting for us. Our server was amazing! Great conversation and not at all intrusive. Literally any question we had about an item on the menu, whether it be food or wine, she was able to answer in great detail. I ordered the Linguini di Maré (linguini with mussels, clams, calamari, white prawns, market fish, in a white wine herb broth), and it was wonderful. Every flavor stood out, none competing with the other. The broth was very light and the entire dish perfectly balanced. He ordered the Agnello al Forno (roasted lamb sirloin, rosemary polenta, ratatouille vegetables, caselvetrano olives) and devoured every last bite....before making his way to my dish. lolol
The mood in the restaurant is very intimate and cozy. There are candles everywhere creating the perfect romantic evening out with your partner, date night-anniversary-or just because.
Thank you again, IL Bistro crew! We had the perfect evening and cannot wait to return."

The bar is open until 2 but I think food is only available until midnight. Happy Hour specials are also great. Folks in the service industry come here after work and I love that about the place.

This is my favorite stop for a prefunk, dinner, happy hour, etc.
The Venue is dark and equipped for live music. Beautiful red roses salute the bar as beautiful orange lanterns illuminate the detail in the bartenders craft. Dan the man is my favorite. Bar manager, relatable genius, daring mixologist, and a class act. I come with a different request every day and his drinks not only satisfy but inspire.

"Palermo-Ballard","https://www.yelp.com/biz/palermo-ballard-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James T.","Had dinner for the first time here tonight and it was great. Our server greeted us and took our drink orders promptly, and our food arrived much faster than we had anticipated. The pizza was fantastic, I got the Palermo special and it was the perfect combination of topping flavors, rich cheese and perfectly cooked crust. The menu variety was a little shocking for such a small place, I was pleasantly surprised by how many options I could pick from. I will have to come back to try some of the specials that our server suggested, they all sounded delicious but tonight we were in the mood for pizza.
The only downside to our visit was something a few members of our party witnessed. We noticed a young woman eating in the back of house in full view of the restaurant. I'm not sure what her role was, for the most part she was simply standing around talking with other employees and eating from what I saw, but regardless it was pretty off-putting to see what appeared to be an employee eating in the back of house where guests could see her. It made me wonder what the standards for that sort of thing in Palermo's back of house were. Having worked in restaurants for a while I'm assuming that this was a one time mistake that doesn't happen frequently, as I know there are usually strict rules about not eating where guests can see you. I hope that the employee is talked to about the behavior!
Other than that one negative experience, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food."

The service is not great, not bad. I have had one very inattentive sever and several nice servers, but none of them seem particularly happy to serve you. They do have $3 a glass wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays (I believe those are the correct days) which is a plus."

I was pleased to see there was a nice lunch menu. We ordered the mini pizza which is I believe $8.50 and you can choose two toppings. We chose mushrooms and pepperoni (YUM!) It also comes with the soup of the day or salad. We also got the chicken fetuccine alfredo ($10.50) which also comes with your choice of the soup or salad. Since we were sharing, we ordered both a soup and a salad.
The soup of the day was chicken noodle. I was actually really impressed with the soup. I loved how thick the noddle was and the flavor of the broth was really good. The noodle was the perfect texture! The pizza was way smaller than we thought it would be, it was really yummy though. The fetuccine alfredo tasted pretty mediocre, no complaints. The two breadsticks it came with was really good.. nice crunch and yummy garlic flavor.
They have happy hour which is nice, I might come again during those times. They also serve breakfast all day! The food was good but I wasn't blown away."

The Classico meat pizza was very much American-style - thicker crust and tasty albeit crazy dense. It's not often I start feeling full after just one slice. This was quickly outshone by some creamy, derricious fettuccini carbonara. The pappardelle al pesto, however, was surprisingly overcooked and one-note in flavor.
On the upside, portions were gargantuan and we barely made it through half our of dishes.
Overall, a decent spot for Italian that leaned a little too far towards run-of-the-mill Italian American ""red sauce"" fare."

Favorite thing about this place: I love the huge selection of items. It's almost overwhelming. And very reasonably priced. Everyone who ordered pasta said it was to die for, too.
Ambience/Location: The ambiance isn't anything super fancy or special, but they do have nice windows in the front to let lots of natural light in."

Pizza isn't great, pasta isn't great, service is all right but nothing to rave about. Very disappointed. There are a lot of better Italian restaurants the Seattle area.
The good thing is that there was no one inside at noon so we didn't have to wait... empty at noon, this could have been my red flag."

However, today, I decided to try something different and ordered the frittata/quiche. It
WAS not that at all! Lol instead it was an egg pizza (which I would NOT have ordered if it was properly labeled in the menu).
It was truly unfortunate, as that was my meal, and hopefully my friends' kid who will be coming over later will eat it.
It bothered me most because I hate wasting food AND money, however, honestly, it was a good laugh!!"

I do think that the food was lacking in depth. My Caesar salad was drenched in dressing where I only ate about half of it... but their garlic bread and wine made up for it. We also called about 15 minutes prior and they happily reserved a table for us!!! Even though it wasn't busy, the gesture made us feel special."

Husband always gets the all day breakfast special (eggs, bacon, French toast). We prefer their French toast over their pancakes. And sometimes it comes with jam (really good jam that makes me think it's homemade). Sometimes we get jam sometimes we don't.... I've had a variety of dishes off both breakfast and dinner menus and everything I've had was delicious. The little scone that comes with some breakfast items is to die for! Recently I had their veggie pizza and it was the tastiest veggie pizza I've ever had! Don't forget to take the bill with you as it's a coupon for $2 off any breakfast item on your next visit!

We came here for lunch the other day and were starving, so we got a medium pizza AND the chicken wing appetizer to share.
The wings came out hot, juicy, and delicious.
The pizza was good as well, nothing to write home about but definitely good, and we ended up leaving with nearly half because we got absolutely stuffed.
The interior is very clean, and our server was very attentive and nice."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Steve A.","This is our favorite restaurant in Seattle. Birthday dinner? Vendemmia. Anniversary? Vendemmia. Seattle Restaurant week? Definitely Vendemmia. Happy Hour? Vendemmia.
If you order the tasting menu you get all of the appetizers, pastas and mains to share with the table. We always go with the wine parings when we do the tasting menu. However they make some yummy and creative cocktails too so check out the drink specials too!
Our menu faves are the beef tartare, the beets and goat cheese, and practically any of their fabulous fresh pasta dishes. I will typically go with a beef or pork entree and my partner will usually have the fish. We are never disappointed."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","WOW really enjoyed this place tonight. We booked a 7 pm reservation for two on a Thursday evening just for fun. Came in to a nice open bar/kitchen space with intimate table settings. There were maybe 10 tables total ranging from 2 tops to 4 tops for the most part as well as some bar seats.
Drinks - enjoyed my cocktail (union mezcal drink) but switched over to wine as it felt more fitting with pasta. Decent wine by the glass list with a lot of variety, as well as some bottle options. I really liked the Zingari Rosso which was a cherry-forward, lighter sangio blend.
Apps. I don't think we had one thing we didn't like. We started with a half dozen oysters. They weren't big but they were sure delicious. The vinaigrette was amazing. We also had beets and burrata. Beets were different than I've ever had them. They were yellow beets and more savory with herbs and arugula vs the traditional red beets with goat cheese and nuts that you can order at most places. The burrata with eggplant was a party in my mouth. The perfect mix of creamy and savory with the eggplant. The bread was oily (in a good way) and toasted to perfection.
Pasta. We ordered 3 because we couldn't choose. The squid ink tagliarini was the special of the night and my favorite one. It was savory and spicy and relatively light tasting with a good amount of dungeness crab. The tagliatelle was awesome as well with fresh egg noodles and oxtail. My least favorite was the agnolotti because it was sweet tasting and very rich (almost like a Cinnabon) but if you have a hankering for sweeter dishes, this is perfect for you. Definitely different vs other agnolotti dishes. Wouldn't order again but glad to have tried.
We passed on dessert because of the sheer amount of food we ordered but they had some interesting desserts including housemade limoncello. 2 drinks each and all that food was about $200 with tip which is a bit high for a random week day but it was well worth it and I basically have a full tagliatelle for lunch tomorrow.
We will be back! Thanks for the nice evening."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ivy L.","A friend recommended Vendemmia to me and I'm so glad I tried it! We made reservations for a Sunday evening and we're glad we did - cause all the tables were pretty full for a Sunday evening! We were celebrating a friend's bday. Service was great and everyone was friendly. The ambiance was good for a date - Dim lighting, easy atmosphere for conversation, not super huge or cramped.
*Hamachi Crudo - I've had this at so many restaurants, I almost feel like it's overdone. But this one was so fresh and so so different! It came with a green pickled blend on top - apparently gooseberry, cucumber and basil. Fresh and delicious! 5/5
*Snap Peas - with Dungeness Crab, Endive and Chives. I've never had snap peas served this way but the dish itself is light in flavor so you get the crunch of the snap peas but can still taste the Dungeness crab. I thought it needed more flavor, especially coming out directly after the hamachi crudo. 3/5
*Burrata - Bosc Pear, Pistachio and Grilled Bread. This dish was so good! We loved everything about the burrata spread and the mix of flavors with the pear! Bread was nice and toasty! 5/5
*Beef Tartare - shallot and grilled bread. This wasn't my favorite beef tartare cause the flavors were again light and there wasn't anything special about this tartare. 3/5
*Tagliatelle with Braised Duck - O.M.G and we have a winner for the night! This pasta dish was fantastic! Noodles cooked right, sauce in point, Duck was tender small pieces and definitely not gamey. My bf doesn't like Duck and loved this dish. There was a dried mushroom in the dish that gave it a crunch. Not sure with else but it was amazing! We all said we would come back just for this dish alone!! 6/5
*Rigatoni with a Lamb Ragu, oregano and pecorino. I think Vendemmia does pasta dishes best! This one can't compare to the braised duck tagliatelle but if we came and had this dish first, it would have been just as perfect! Good Ragu sauce, pasta cooked perfectly. 5/5
*Smoked Potato - tasted like it sounds with mustard and charred onion. Ok dish - nothing to rave about. 2/5
*Rainbow Carrots with pickled green walnuts, feta and honey. Sweet and delicious! Veggies done right! 4/5
*Tri Tip Steak with Celery Root, Squash and Watercress. One of my least favorite dishes of the night. The steak was tough and the flavors were just ok. 2/5
*Pork Chop with nectarine, olive and a verde. We didn't like any of the protein dishes at Vendemmia. Pork chop was tough and none of the flavors went together in this dish. The nectarine didn't add to the dish cause of the way it was done. The olives and the verde were a weird mix. Stick to pastas and some of the sides! 1/5
*Ricotta Cake, Pear Sorbet and Panna Cotta - the pear sorbet was the winner of the 3. So good and tasted so fresh with so much pear flavors! So good that my bf has been talking about it and looking for pear sorbet the last week. Yum! Ricotta cake was a nice moist cake - nothing special. And the panna cotta was very savory if you want a savory dessert. But do yourself a favor and get that pear sorbet!
Overall, a great dining experience! I would definitely come back but now I know what to order cause there were definitely dishes we loved and dishes we hated! More good dishes than bad though! Get the pastas!!!"
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dominic D.","Overall, a quaint and romantic restaurant with good value for the quality of food served. We attended as a larger group (6), and they were able to accommodate us within the back private dining area (lovely design and private).
For food, we had the following: Hamachi (all loved; fresh and balanced), Snap Peas (salad format; creative and light), Brussels Sprouts (not recommended; basic), Shelling Beans (ok), Burrata (delicious), Garganelli (beautiful smoked pork), Pure Cod (very well done; fresh; light), Spaghetti (great).
For drinks we limited our cocktails as we found variety limited. The negroni was nothing special and not worth the price. There was a great table red for $9, with heavy pours."

"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carol B.","What a wonderful night out. My partner and I were craving pasta and ice cream when we decided to venture into Madrona for date night. We enjoyed some wonderful Italian food and cocktails that evening.
Food: pasta is fresh and to die for. Incredibly rich and flavorful with generous portion sizing. We started with an appetizer of oysters which were perfectly fine, but priced a bit higher than market value.
Cocktails: spirit forward and expertly made. Honestly there nothing more to say
Atmosphere: The staff was delightful. There's a small indoor are and even smaller patio seating. Interestingly, they reported being booked up on the phone but the restaurant didn't fill the entire evening. Fortunately, the patio is first come first serve so we were seated quickly when we arrived."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex V.","Absolutely incredible. We were here on the recommendation of my friend, and wow, all the dishes were spot on. Our shared order of beef tartare served with garlic toast was so delightful and held our appetite over until the main courses arrive. I ordered the New York prime medium-rare while my girlfriend ordered the smoked potatoes, and both dishes were so good, it was almost sad when we completed our meals lol. While the inside was a bit loud with everyone speaking, the window table facing the street of the quiet neighbourhood definitely helped detract from the noise. The decor is fantastic and the staff is super friendly. If you want a more fancy feel to your dinner, check this place out. A little on the pricey side, but absolutely worth every penny spent!"

It has a small bar area in the back and a dozen or so tables, with a fully open kitchen so you can see all the happenings. We ordered the oysters, hamachi, butrata, beets, risotto, and clam pasta. All were excellent, memorable dishes and I would recommend them all. Service was wonderful with good advice about the dishes, attentive water and wine filling, and a friendly attitude. Highly recommend this for a date night or girls night with a smaller, intimate group. Don't think it would lend itself for large groups because of the layout"
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sebastian T.","Came here for a friends birthday and I was intrigued to try out this highly reviewed spot. At first glance, its a classier, nice looking spot, and the menu prices confirm this first impression. Overall, it looks like a higher class tapas joint.
We ordered a few things for the table and I can attest that the food is of higher quality with its ingredients and flavor combinations refreshing & done well. My favorites were the lamb sirloin & burrata. Even though the bread was toasted a tad too long, it was hard to bite into, but simply bend the bread a bit and the crust will yield when biting into it. The cheese mixed with the hearty eggplant was a light creamy combination that was surprising. The lamb was beyond amazing with the herbs, mustard seed, and especially the mint. The rest of the dishes were pretty average. I would recommend ordering at least 1 pasta as its somewhat filling for the price compared to the other dishes. Even though I've had better pasta, I can say that its above average.
If you're looking for a nice date spot, or just some higher quality, lower quantity food, I'd recommend checking out this spot! Some items are hit or miss, but I was overall satisfied. Since the menu rotates I wouldn't mind coming back here and there, but its a bit expensive for a commonly visited spot."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ruben A.","Here's the short version of this. Food: fantastic. Cannot be beat. Service: poor. Beyond poor.
We are visiting from California and decided we wanted good food. We have a two year old that typically does well when we take him to eat. Yesterday was not the case. The restaurant staff made it very clear this place is not child friendly. However, I will not write a whole review just on this. Here are the pros and cons.
Pros:
-Hanger steak. Delicious. Tastes like it was sous vide then finished on the grill. Perfectly done.
-Black cod was slightly fishy. Other food it was paired with was spot on and cut through the fish taste. Incredible.
- The beef tartare appetizer was savory. Meaty and beautiful.
- Hamachi appetizer in at a loss for words. Fresh. Savory.
Cons:
- Servers. Big party came in before us. I asked if they were making all their food first and if ours would be coming up. Their response ""everything is made to order and takes time to come to you."" Being from the food industry, this is an idiotic response. For one, it's an open kitchen and I can clearly see everything is being made.
- Warm/cold food. Steak was amazing, but when it arrived to us, it was warm at best.
- Inconsistent seasoning. Some dishes were almost too heavy on the salt. Some had none.
Overall, I rate the food at a 4.5 or even a five. The service a 1. Thus the 3 star rating."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda C.","Best Restaurant Week restaurant!!! I'm so glad my friend brought me here (shoutout to Mona - sup girlfriend). They give the table all 4 appetizers options on the prix fixe, and you pick 1 entree and 1 dessert.
Mizuna Salad (4/5): Great start to the meal, loved the crushed almonds/cheese on this salad
Calamari (4/5): Super refreshing! Not what you expect - the calamari is not deep fried and there's no breading (which makes it look naked) but it went great with celery and cauliflower. Healthy calamari option :)
Asparagus on savory panna cotta (5/5): I had never heard of a savory panna cotta before but that stuff comes from the Italian heavens. It's this amazing garlicky sauce that would make any vegetable your favorite.
Tagliatelle with ricotta and peas (5/5): Perfect pasta texture! The ricotta made the pasta interestingly sour but it really balanced out the cheesiness of this dish. Loved this creative pasta!
Risotto, mascarpone, mint (4/5): Would have preferred it if it weren't made with mixed grains (brown rice), but this felt like a healthy option!
Duck confit (5/5): ......THIS DUCK is why I will be returning to Vendemmia. Perfectly crisp skin on a melt-in-your-mouth duck leg, the best finely-mashed potatoes on the side, and the green
/ orange drizzle sauces made this dish top notch. I'd be hard pressed to find a more delicious duck.
Halibut (4/5): Nice crispy skin on this halibut too, but does not compare to the duck :)
Rhubarb panna cotta (5/5): If you like panna cotta, you will LOVE this jiggly wiggly panna cotta topped with oats.
Ricotta cake (5/5): My favorite dessert of the night - it looks like a cheese cake but it's not nearly as creamy/fatty/sweet. The cake itself is not sweet, but the raisins and almonds on the side made this dish so surprisingly great!
Tiramisu (5/5): It comes to your table as a deconstructed tiramisu cake, with pieces all over the place, which is pretty cool. Definitely one of the healthier tiramisu's I've had (seems to be a common thread among all their dishes) and I love that!
I'll be back, Vendemmia! And please have the duck confit on your rotating menu when I'm there!!"
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Vicky T.","$50 for a tasting menu?! What a steal! We were more than full after leaving Vendemmia last night. We had 12 courses. We started with, penn cove oysters, juicy heirloom tomatoes, garden cucumbers, the sweetest melons I've had in a long time and the most delicious fish crostini. We gobbled everything up! Then came the hamachi collar! OMG!! I literally sucked the bones clean I kid you not. We were given not 1 pasta dish, but 3! The server let us put in a preference of which of the 4 pastas we wanted. We opted for the agnolotti. All of the pastas were delicious! We finished with 2 different desserts, a chocolate dessert with a hint of coffee and a yummy almond cake with peach compote. My favs of the night were the heirloom tomatoes, melon appetizer, hamachi collar, fish crostini, the agnolotti and the almond cake dessert, basically everything was delicious!"

"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny C.","Seattle Restaurant Week April 2018
Service: Bad. She forgot one of the 4 starters and we didn't realize this until after we paid and I snapped a photo of the menu for Yelp. Her response? ""Sorry, I wish you had told me earlier."" And that was it. Keeping track of the courses is her job, not mine. We put 2 cards down, she asked if we wanted to split it and she ran my card twice. Our server Anna basically did a crappy job.
Food:
Starters
1. Octopus--Octopus was so tender and the cauliflower had a nice crunch.
2. Asparagus--Missing
3. Mizuno salad--Felt very spring. It was a nice balance to the heavier pasta.
4. Tagliatelle--My favorite after the octopus. The pasta had fresh peas (a bit too firm) and a minty cream sauce.
Main
Halibut--Preparation could be better. One piece of halibut was nicely seared and the other had no sear on it at all so that nice crunchy top was missing. The fish itself was very tender but I could have used a bit more sauce.
Dessert
1. Ricotta cake--It was served warm!! Make sure to get this. It was so tender and we loved the grapes and almonds on top.
2. Panna Cotta--Skip. It was creamy and dense but the topping didn't do much for it. I would opt for the tiramisu instead. That looked better once i saw it.
I still think this place is a good deal for SRW but next time I'm going to watch the server closely to make sure I get everything that I paid for."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenn C.","We love coming to Vendemmia! Their simple spaghetti never disappoints. The pastas tend to be pretty al dente, which is my preference. The veggies and small plates that I've tried over time have always been good. I tried the beef tartare on my most recent trip and was very happy with it. Nice wine selection.
The only negative comment I have is that the tomato based meat pastas tend to be salty (aside from one or two staples, their pasta selection changes frequently, and there are usually one or two meat ones). Most recently, it was the beef shank paccheri that was borderline TOO salty. Everything was cooked well and the flavors/richness were good, but definitely very salty. My boyfriend agreed, and he even had a cold that was dulling his taste buds. Normally I would say this is a one-off, but I've had similar experiences in previous visits, one involving some type of a bolognese sauce. So, we always get one spaghetti to be safe :)
I haven't been here for Happy Hour yet (I attached a menu since I couldn't find one posted anywhere) but based on the prices it seems like a great deal to get some of their staples. Absolutely would be back to try the HH tartare, spaghetti, and a glass of wine :)"
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","This is a two part Yelp belated post from a birthday celebration (6/9/15) and for Day 1 of Seattle Restaurant Week campaign (10/15/17). Both dinner visits were specifically with the intent of celebrating at Vendemmia.
The first visit was a culinary revelation along the retail and restaurant row on 34th Avenue in Seattle's Madrona neighborhood. Definitely something different from my visits at St. Clouds or Hi Spot Café. This uplifted my spirits since I was worn out juggling a new job and dealing with an ailing parent. As a cancer warrior, I treasure each birthday I get to celebrate. I recall the lovely atmosphere, impeccable service, and amazing food. It was a feast for the senses. I just located my digital photos and posted them this evening (11/15/17). Who knows where that digital camera went? Thank goodness I had transferred these photos to a file on my ancient laptop.
In the interim, I had enjoyed several visits to the late Contadino over on 19th E in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Still hadn't checked out East Anchor Seafood (Madrona) or Raccolto (West Seattle) though. I was saddened when Contadino had closed. I had made a mental note that I needed to revisit Vendemmia.
I had that opportunity a month ago (10/15/17) during the first day of the Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW) campaign. My sennin-so shiatsu LMP reminded me that I really needed to make the effort to take better care of myself and partake in fun activities of my choosing. Gave myself plenty of time to deal with traffic, found parking by Vendemmia, but had a tiny mocha first at a nearby indie café. Yes, it would have been more enjoyable to be with others, but this 6pm reservation was solo for the purpose of taking myself out on a 'date'. Life's too short to expect magic to happen, especially with my chaotic roller coaster called life.
I was seated at a two top by the entrance and host stand. I had a great view of the open kitchen, but was not distracted by the full restaurant and bar scene. I was really focused on each dish brought to my table. I was shocked that I was given all four of the starters. So rather than the expected three courses for SRW, I had experienced six!
The flavors (with a capitol F), textures, visual composition were incredible. I had to remind myself that I had to pace myself. I still ended up having to box up some of my starters (charred broccoli and chicory apple salad) but definitely the Hamachi crudo and pork loin with tonnato were devoured! Same fate happened with half of the herb stuffed porchetta with autumn squash and pickled chanterelles. Made for an amazing lunch the next day. I barely made it through the dessert selected, the baked budino, as I thought of the Monty Python reference of 'one thin mint'. Overindulged, but overall dining experience was phenomenal.
The cuisine and service were memorable that photos from 6/9/15 and my visit a month ago on 10/15/17 remain vivid. Vendemmia is definitely highly recommended!"
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jo V.","Update: Still great service however celeriac soup tasted like corn starch, hubby's cavatelli was heavily salted, tagliatelle and green bean appetizer were great. $90 plus tip, ouch!
Next time in Seattle, will be seeking out another restaurant for Italian food."

Definitely has the look of a place women would like to go. ""Trendy"". I had a pasta dish with pork, which was pretty good. They have Rainier tall cans for $4, another good choice.
Overall everyone who went enjoyed the spot. The waitress was very helpful with suggesting cocktails and attendant with our table."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Isaac H.","Spend an evening with Mike and you'll get one of Seattle's most uniquely cozy and fun dining experiences. He'll start by placing his big hands on your table and asking about your dietary restrictions, and then drop his signature, ""Are you ready for a beautiful dinner?""
And with that, the plates start coming. Things start slowly with salad and bread, then graduate to an array of dishes from eggplant to steak to mussels to cannelloni. I've experienced some variation in quantity, but proper planning for the 4-7 courses means foregoing the usual afternoon snack.
The food comes to just $35, though raspberry lemonade and dessert are hard to resist. Plan a full two hours. The pace and atmosphere will make you want to linger, and you don't want to miss any courses!"
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Prachi S.","01/31/2020 - update to my previous review.
Very disappointed with the service. Have had amazing experiences past 2 times which is why we went to celebrate my husband's birthday with a group of 7. Usually we have got atleast a 5+ course and a dessert. This time we got a penne pasta, ravioli, cheese garlic bread (which is note really a main course) .. post which the server thought we should've been done and offered dessert. BUT we were still hungry and expected more, so she just REPEATED the pasta dish. We finally asked if we could get some chicken/pesto mushroom pasta (atleast a diff sauce base)!!!!
Did not see the main Chef Mike (I believe that's his name) for whom we actually went there as he is amazing. Not sure if this place has become too commercial or was it just a busy Friday night. I would def avoid weekend nights since it didn't feel customized (for which this place was my favorite) at all.
Love the place. Chef is amazing!!!!!!
There is no menu. The chef talks to u and understands exactly what you would like and are in the mood to eat and goes above and beyond to make a special customized meal for you. Make sure you let me know of any allergies or dislikes befo.
Been there 2 times to celebrate special occasions and have had an amazing experience every time!!"
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katie D.","WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. I wish I could give this place 0 stars. My friend and I originally came here to buy a bottle of wine for her boyfriend because he said this resturant had it.
We were sat at a table and served wine before we could really get a word out and we weren't even ID'ed which I thought was strange. We had our IDs out and the owner gave us a weird look like we didnt need to show them to him.
The food kept coming and there were no menus. The meals are apparently ""customized"" but the dishes were what everyone else was getting as well. The food itself was terrible. We were getting nauseas after the 3rd course. I couldnt even identify some of the food. We finally asked one of the servers to box our next course because we wanted to just pay and leave. The owner also asked us if we wanted a refill of our wine and we said no. Five minutes later he pours us a second glass. We recieved dessert which was pretty basic but not nauseating.
Then the bill comes, it totaled about $110 for two people. Keep in mind there were no questions about what our budget was and no insight to how much these ""customized"" dishes cost. We were also charged for a full bottle of wine which we definitely did not consume. We were also charged an extra 10 dollars for desert...which we thought would be included in a 4-7 course meal. The owner came by and apologized for charging us for a full bottle of wine...and then told us to basically not TIP to make up for it.
So instead of just quickly refunding us and printing out a new ticket, he decided to screw over his servers who were definately pooling tip!
This place and its owner is a joke."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Leslie Q.","Came here for my and SO's anniversary dinner and had a rather disappointing meal. We were put on Pasta Freska (PF) by a co-worker of mine who lives in WA. We came on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't busy at all (maybe 2 other small parties besides us).
PF is located on the intersection of like three streets. We arrived at around 7PM and were seated right away. The gimmick with PF is that there really is no menu - the chef comes talk to you and finds your likes/dislikes/allergies and accommodates you depending on what you say.
For us, the chef or owner or whatever literally asked us, ""Ok what don't you like"". SO said seafood/spicy. Then he was off to the kitchen. When he came back, he slopped our first dish on each of our plates with no comment on what it was, or what the dish consisted of. Apparently we were just suppose to shut up and eat whatever it was. Next dish, same thing. I seriously had to stop him and ask wtf we were being served. I don't know if it was just an off night or if it was because the chef/owner's friends came by that night so he didn't give as much of a sht. But man, it really soured the experience for the both of us. For a restaurant with no menu, I was half-expecting the chef to describe what he was putting on our plates.
Luckily, another man, who was much nicer and conversational, helped us with answering our questions, getting us water, tea, and new plates (when ours were covered in previous dish's sauce). I liked that guy.
Anyways, all the food was really meh. I did enjoy the mussels and one (1) prawn tho. Everything else tasted phoned in/generic Italian/not impressive or stand-out. Without ordering any alcohol, our bill still came out to over $100. Wtf? Seemed overpriced for the tapas-style plates we received (refer to 8 pc tortellini and broccoli pics)."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mandie R.","I asked around with some local ladies for a fun place to bring my husband for his birthday, and this came up with the recommendation ""if you like something unusual and you like Italian, this is the place to go."" Sold.
We arrived for our 6pm reservation to find we were the only customers in the place (it was completely full when we left a little over an hour later) and were taken to a table by our very quick and quiet waiter whose name I never did catch. The building layout is very unusual, but it ended up being great because it really isolated sound and kept it from getting incredibly loud for such a small dining room.
Chef Mike came to say hi and check to see what we couldn't have (Shellfish for me, Spinach for my husband), and if we prefer our food spicier or more mild. He brought me a glass of a lovely red (many people mention bottles, we weren't offered one nor did we request one) that I'm guessing was a Syrah blend but honestly I couldn't tell you and I had an impossible time trying to get an answer as to what things were.
The salad was fine; lettuce, goat(?) cheese, tomato, zingy dressing. I wasn't really here for salad so no complaints.
Round 1 was an Eggplant dish, Round 2 was Spaghetti, Round 3 was unidentifiable-- my husband got a plate of maybe pork(?) in a red sauce with broccoli in a runny white sauce that mixed unappealingly with the other sauce; I got some manner of stuffed pasta with a Spinach sauce, Round 4 was 4 mussels and a prawn for my husband and a breaded fish in white sauce for me. Dessert was a little sampler of three items.
We both enjoyed Rounds 1 and 2, round 3 we both hated and barely touched, round 4 was okay.
All told even with a full dining room we didn't feel forgotten or rushed. We both left full and wanting to visit again, service was spot on, but I'm REALLY not thrilled that I couldn't get anyone to stop and tell me what I was eating/drinking and what was in it-- if we do go back I'm going to be a lot more pushy about it.
For two with a glass of wine we came in at about $95 before tip."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley H.","Coming here was such a fun, delicious experience! I highly recommend this place! Once your seated you're met by friendly staff who pour you a great glass of wine to go with the food they're preparing for the evening. There is no menu, so staff will ask for your preferences and then get ready for a four or five course meal that has been created for the evening! They literally bring out your table's food straight from the skillet and place it on your plate. It's an amazing experience and everything was delicious!"
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","John T.","This ones a bit difficult to write. Five of us ordered take-out/delivery from this place. I had chicken pesto, my wife had chicken alfredo, and the others ordered spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, and seafood risotto.
This experience wasn't all that bad, and my wife and I actually got lucky with our dishes. I loved loved loved my chicken pesto which was near perfect. It was so creamy and delicious and had pieces of zucchini inside that were amazing. My wife's chicken alfredo was also amazing. I couldn't stop eating hers. Both of our pasta noodles were perfectly cooked as well. Lastly, the garlic bread was soooooo delicious. Sooo much garlic I was in heaven.
Despite the above, we had to give 2 stars based on the service... nothing to do with the taste of the food. The spaghetti was ordered with no cheese due to a lactose issue. Unfortunately, it was covered with parmesan which made it inedible. The risotto unfortunately had no risotto. It was regular pasta... perhaps angel hair? Lastly, they failed to include any utensils or napkins.
It was too bad. If the orders were correct, this might've been a 4- or 5-star rating. And perhaps this was just a one time issue. Moreover, if you actually ate at the restaurant, you would've probably avoided this experience, in which case the food would've just been delicious."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristen K.","What an unexpected and wonderful experience!
In this unassuming, triangle-shaped restaurant located just off Westlake Avenue N, you will find a meal unlike any other.
At first, you walk into the restaurant and are greeted by the friendly staff. If you've been here before, it's likely that they'll remember you. The server -- Taylor, Marcelina, or possibly Ali, the son of Mike the owner (sorry if I've misspelled any of your names) -- won't bring you a menu. Instead, they'll ask you if you'd like anything to drink, about your dietary preferences, and if there is anything you can't / don't like to eat.
Then, the meal begins. They'll bring you a bottle of wine -- whatever they think you'll like. And then comes course after course of delicious perfection.
As my uncle put it, ""The worst part about coming here is that you eat something amazing and don't know what it is!""
This is what I remember:
- Two bottles of red wine
- Salad
- Garlic bread (so soft and perfectly toasted!)
- Breaded rockfish
- Mussels, clams, prawns
- Eggplant parmesan (definitely the winner tonight. So good.)
- Chicken thigh with goat cheese
- Spinach cannelloni stuffed with fish and shrimp
- Canneloni with chicken
- Pasta (they bring this straight out of the kitchen and serve it from a big pan)
- Four assorted desserts (Flan, spumoni ice cream, chocolate truffles with cherry sauce, and some sort of mango mousse sponge cake)
And that's just what I remember.
We were so full we practically rolled out of the restaurant. Then we all waddled straight to our beds in a deep food coma.
You may expect all of this to come at some insane price -- But all of this came out to just over $200 for the three of us (including tax, tip, and all that wine). Perfectly reasonable for what you get!
Basically, you will love Pasta Freska if you like the idea of:
- A family-owned restaurant with a casual, friendly, and intimate environment.
- A multiple-course gourmet meal with no menu.
- Exploring and sharing good food with good friends.
You may not like it if:
- You are a picky eater with specific dietary restrictions.
- You are a germaphobe and don't like sharing plates with other people.
- You need a menu and the feeling of control.
Otherwise, I totally recommend Pasta Freska to anyone and everyone looking for a true Seattle gem."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Diane S.","Got a to go order, and wasn't very impressed. The food was ok, nothing special but not bad. Just seems pricey for ok pasta. Service was great about getting us our food. Just wished their were either better portions or more exciting pasta."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mia C.","Came here last night with my friend. I would rate as below:
Service: 4. All the staff were very nice and filed our water very quickly. It must be hard to keep track of all the tables though because things either came to the table a little too fast or came not quite hot. They fixed it by the 3rd course though, so all good there.
Food: 3 I liked all of the different dishes they brought out. Salad, bread, crab, eggplant Parmesan, and spaghetti. They all tasted okay but none blew my mind. The salad, bread, and the spaghetti were pretty much what you would get at any chain Italian restaurant, the eggplant Parmesan was a bit soggy and chewy. The crab was my favorite. Desserts were good. but seem like they were premade all at the beginning of the day.
Value: 2. For a bottle of wine and two dinners and a dessert, it was $128+tip and tax. The price of the wine, $44 is reasonable, but as someone who knows wine, the wine glasses are terrible and it's a small fix to get better wine glasses to get the full potential out of the wine. Dessert was an extra $9, which was not told to us. I would have liked the option to decide if I wanted to pay extra for dessert. So that leaves the actual dinner at $30 per person. With 5 small courses I would say the quality was not worth the $30 for what I would have paid $15/person for at Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo.
Don't think I'd come back with so many other great Italian places in Seattle like Artusi, Spinasse, Cuoco, etc."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Itzel S.","My husband suggested we try this restaurant after viewing the menu on Open Table and Yelp. When we got there and asked to see the menu, the waitress said ""we don't do that, you need to trust us."" After probing she provided a brief vague description of the process- Basically it's a Chef's Selection 5 course meal - then asked if we had any dietary restrictions. After expressing some concerns with the whole just trust us thing, she promised she would accommodate all of my restrictions.
We pressed on and decided to keep an open mind. We had to wait 15-20 minutes between courses. The food was average at best - oddly reminiscent of something you'd get from Chef Boyardee. Not to mention they serve it to you with ZERO description of what was just placed in front of you. I guess this is what they meant by ""just trust us.""
If that wasn't bad enough, over an hour in, while waiting for the third course, the chef/owner approaches us and asks that we could please get up and move because he'd forgotten about a large party that needed our table.
I personally feel that listing an itemized menu on places like Yelp and Open Table, when what they really offer is only a Chef's Selection menu, is misleading and confusing. Especially as a diabetic patron who needs to know what I'm about to consume in order to administer the right amount of insulin. (PSA: If you have any kind of dietary restrictions, please avoid this place at all costs)
Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment. The service was poor, the mystery ""meh"" portions were small and the entire experience was frustrating and confusing. If you're looking for subpar Italian food and mediocre service go to The Olive Garden - at least there, you know what you're signing up for."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sagar K.","SO I will have to leave a relatively short review for a good reason you'll know after you visit the restaurant.

The Horri family puts their heart in this restaurant and you feel it the moment you walk in, must visit!"
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","jill g.","I have been coming here for almost 20 years, how have I not written a yelp review? This place is nothing short of darling and you are practically guaranteed to have a great experience. The main thing you need to know: no menus. You read that right, there are no menus. Mike, the owner and chef and sweetheart of a human being will come to your table and see what you don't eat. One person doesn't want shellfish? No problem. One person is a vegetarian? No worries. One person doesn't like any kind of seafood or spicy or long pasta or mushrooms? No worries. Mike has you covered. Once that convo has happened, all you need to do at that point is sit back and relax and wait for plate after plate of food to be delivered to you. There will be an appetizer. There will be a salad. And there will be other foods that will blow your mind. And without exaggeration, in the hundred or so times I have eaten here I've never had the same meal twice.
And do not forget to leave room for dessert! Flan, tiramisu, cheesecake, ice cream, cannoli - True to form you never know what you are going to get but it's going to be amazing.
Evening parking directly across the street is plentiful and free. But you might want to walk for a few miles to burn off all of the food you just ate :-)"
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeremy S.","I've been going to Pasta Freska since 10 years ago and it hasn't really changed much. The decor is very similar if not the same and food tastes like homemade Italian food.
Pasta Freska is a great place to go to when you don't want to think about a menu instead of wanting to go somewhere you can socialize with some friends or a date. I wont describe too much of the experience because many Yelp reviewers already have.
I just have a few notes to make: one time I made reservations via their website. When I was there with a date, a server came up to us and I told them we had reservations. He responded with ""Really, are you sure?"" as if he couldn't find us. It was weird because I even had text proof that it was booked. He then said ""hold on one second"" and left. It wasn't until someone else came (I think the owner) that he asked how many we had again and sat us. It was kind of a weird situation.
Then last night, I went there with 3 of my friends who booked via Open Table and we got there at 6:30pm. There was at least 15 people in the front waiting and the host said they were running late and backed up. He didn't check or write anything down. So we got the feeling that we wouldn't be able to get our seats and after waiting a while, we left. The funny thing is, I used Open Table to find some other time tables elsewhere and Pasta Freska was listed with an open table at 7 pm, 7:15 pm. 7:30 pm, etc. which was clearly not going to happen... So I would suggest that you don't trust the reservations here and be prepared to wait. Otherwise come right when they open or on weekdays."

Drove from Shoreline all the way to Westlake via 99/Dexter. Arrived at 1850 for 1900 reservations. All crammed at front entrance with no one recognizing our presence.
Chef shows up handing out wine to placate the masses. I pass...I did a wine tasting across the sound, I'm good. Ate some amazing food earlier from a Ligurian chef/owner. Really I'm good. You ever see someone ""in the weeds""? The entire BOH/FOH. Totally.

I went here on a Thursday with a party of four. It wasn't that busy and we asked to sit on their roof patio. It was so pretty, a scene from Europe! It had flowers blooming with real grape vines growing.
I didn't know this walking in but this place apparently doesn't have any menus. Our server asked us if we want some wine and any allergies or things we don't want to eat.
We said yes to the wine and no on allergies and then we were on our way to a delicious journey. First came out warm garlic bread and a salad which I enjoyed. The following dishes were a little bit of a blur, they just keep coming out! I think our favorites was this crab pasta and a tomato based linguini. Overall, all the dishes were really good. I believed I tried 4-5 dishes. It is served family style as the server has this huge plate of food and they walk around plating everyone's plates with a piece of it.
The dining experience is a little long, we were there for over 2 hours but the servers were pretty attentive.
I was curious of what the price was when we got our bill and it wasn't too bad! We also had a Groupon too.
I would definitely return. It's a fun and relaxing experience and you don't feel rushed here."

In a nutshell...
Great cocktails- it's always fun to try new drinks or their take on old drinks.
Super friendly staff- our server spent quality time explaining the cocktails and foods. We ended up taking many over her recommendations and enjoyed them. She was prompt and efficient. When we were asking questions about the food preparation she sent out the chef to answer our questions.
Food- oh wow. The wings are delicious as were the twice fried chicken thigh nugget thingys although I never tasted the sriracha in the dipping sauce. This was the first time I have ever had mac and cheese that was al dente and the pork on top was tender and flavorful. Cheese puffs were ok and the smashed potatoes were delicious also.

I can't tell you enough. As my friend would put it ""I want to live in this biscuit"" -- then the Hobo Scramble had a little bit of everything, bacon, ham, sausage, potato, and eggs. Perfection.
The restaurant is super cute, good size dining area. The inside also has a bar area with a few TVs. It looks like they have an outdoor area for the summer times. For a rainy Saturday morning, it was decently busy in there!

I ordered the pork cheek Mac and cheese, forever smoked turkey drum, burrata cheese, pimento cheese puffs, butter Lettuce, oysters, and my fav garlic prawns! The meat dishes here are so flavorful and tender; honestly I felt ready to hibernate afterwards
The Burrata cheese is paired with stir fried string beans and sweet tomato topped with onion crisps. The big Burrata on top was so amazing but this dish was honestly a little confusing. I was expecting a salty taste but the sweet tomato really overshadowed the whole dish. It was def a surprising dish, not bad but I couldn't eat a lot of it. So I ate all the Burrata instead lol
The butter Lettuce had a Smokey taste but a little bland. The real highlight of the meal was all the meats and the garlic prawns. So tender and flavor! Those are must try dishes!"

I'll still try it when I'm out for new flavor ideas. The rotating flavor that day was huckleberry and it was a really pretty flavor. I'm not sure if the huckleberry was just overpowering or I've become so used to shrubs the vinegar doesn't hit me as much anymore, but it was still nice and refreshing.
Smoked Bologna Sandwich $14: This is also available during brunch which is Saturday and Sunday 10 AM - 2 PM. I ended up not really liking the mustard on this, and it kind of took over the sandwich flavor wise. It's been ages since I've had a bologna sandwich in my school days, but the meat on this didn't taste super different from what I remember. I did enjoy the broken potatoes as the side.
White Cheddar Grits $5: This was a good portion size for sharing as a side. In terms of grits alone, it was pretty good. My favorite grits were at Fiddlehead when they were open, but I'd order it with a side of sausage gravy. Now I like the grits at Witness in Capitol Hill which has it with bacon gravy for brunch. Basically I'm saying I need gravy to really go next level regarding my enjoyment of grits.
Overall although the food was alright, there's not much else on the current menu I feel inclined to try. I'll probably check on it now and then as I'm definitely open to giving it another shot if something catches my eye.

Located right on California Ave, the restaurant serves for a central place to get there. a good version of Southern, casual food and BBQ. Prices were ok and not ash (maybe ranging about $11-$20 for an entree). Though their menu is not expansive, there are a couple of things we tried that were flavorful and just the right amount of saltiness (such as the garlic shrimp and beef cheeks).

Food was not bad. Service was excellent though.
Food: I went for the basic breakfast... pretty sure that's the name. It came with two eggs, crispy bacon, home fries and a biscuit. The dish literally came out within 5 minutes of ordering. Not sure if this was impressive or concerning... BUT the food was tasty. There were 4 slices of bacon - a ton! The home fries were just okay... they were kind of mushy and I usually like my potatoes crispy. The biscuit, while good, was not the best I've ever had. It was a good texture but lacking flavor even when paired with butter and jam.
Service: we were promptly greeted and seated when my husband and i strolled in at 11am on a Sunday. The service was very warm, friendly and attentive. This restaurant has only been open for four months so I can only hope they sustain this level of service for years to come.
Atmosphere: if I recall correctly there was a bar in the restaurant so wouldn't be surprised if this spot did happy hours and such. We didn't get anything to drink though for brunch. I liked the size of the restaurant - not too big, not too small. The woman who took our check mentioned they have a beautiful patio out back which is super popular during the summer, but we didn't see it in person.
Overall: good standard brunch fare, could use a bit more oomph though. Service is excellent however."

It was a little chilly outside, but not raining so we opted to sit outside by their huge fire pit.
Our server came out pretty quick after seating us and we ordered a couple of whiskey warm drinks. They were delicious. Their HH menu is pretty good too. We had a variety of items to try.
Food is good, service is good, however, it was a little pricey because we ordered drinks that weren't on the HH menu. Overall, a definite must go back to!"

I've only been for dinner on a Friday night and it was a good vibe. Ordered a local beer and the chicken wangs with a side of mac & cheese. All of which was a really delicious pairing. My friend ordered the turkey leg which was huge! - the meat fell off the bone nicely, similar to having it be sous vide. The bar has many options to choose from and the menu was simple yet promising. Customer service was great and engaging, not too bothersome or not enough, just right! This place definitely prides themselves in quality (food, service, aesthetics) without being too overbearing. Brunch looks like it would taste good. Will definitely come back again!"

I ordered 3 dishes. the mushroom dip with chips, the pork cheek Mac and cheese and the pork collar pastrami plate .
Mushroom dip - very flavorful, big fan
Mac and cheese - pork cheek is amazing, super tender and my favorite part of the entire meal, the Mac and cheese was really creamy how I like it but a little salty
Pastrami plate - the pastrami was really good, also very tender, they really pay attention to the details when it comes to their meats
Drinks - Japanese vesper was on special, incredibly smooth and had the faint taste of a stick of juicy fruit gum, loved it.
Over all good experience here, only reason it's not a 5 is, it was pretty pricey. An app, 2 entrees and a couple drinks were $100+ but that's Seattle for ya"

We have been wanting to try this place for a while. The place was packed! The staff was really friendly. We both had coffee and tried their fresh orange juice. Both were delicious. This was the first fresh squeezed orange juice that actually tasted like it was fresh!
I had the chorizo scramble and my husband had the breakfast sandwich. Both were so good! The chorizo tasted so fresh and perfectly spiced. The sandwich had deliciously smoked Canadian bacon on it.
I am so happy we just checked this place out. I can't wait to come back for dinner and another brunch! Love having this great place in west seattle!"

I figured that would be a perfect day to check them out!
The ambience was nice - could be good for a date or just with friends. They were playing some great bluegrass music, which I definitely appreciated. Our waiter was really friendly and checked on us appropriately.
The menu was limited. I had a hard time choosing something off the menu, which is normally a good problem to have, but in this case, it was because nothing really stood out.
Ended up choosing the chorizo scramble with a jalapeño crema and potatoes. The scramble was meh. The chorizo wasn't really the chorizo I was expecting (i'm thinking red and spicy - this was grey and mild). Wasn't very flavorful overall. I think I could've made a better scramble at home to be honest. The potatoes were really good, though! My friends all raved about their potatoes. No one really said anything about their actual meal. The potatoes were salty and perfectly crispy.
I got a bloody mary which was clearly spiced and seasoned. Just the way I like it. My friend got the smoked pineapple mimosa which was very interesting! It didn't taste smoked at first but got smokier and smokier as she got to the bottom, until it was too smoky. Not sure if it wasn't mixed well or something. Ill give that a pass though since it was interesting!
Overall, the food was meh (again, only reviewing brunch). I would like to come back to review their dinner options because I've heard such great things (but I also saw reviews saying not to believe the hype, so who knows). I could also come back just for drinks!"

I had heard about this restaurant from word of mouth and I wanted to try it out. I was greeted warmly by Mona who quickly got me a menu. I decided to order the shrimp and grits. i have not found good shrimp and grits in Seattle. I've had amazing shrimp and grits in the South in places like New Orleans and Atlanta. However, the grits I've tried in Seattle taste like cement. When I received my plate, I was surprised by the arugula on top of the shrimp grits. It was definitely a Pacific Northwest twist on the dish. I loved that the arugula had a pleasant vinaigrette on it. The actual grits were the right texture and immersed with chunks of Andouille sausages that gave it great flavor. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and mixed well with the creamy grits. This was definitely the best shrimp and grits I've had in Seattle and anywhere outside of the South. As I was leaving, the place started filling up. It has a good vibe to it with friendly staff. I would highly recommend Lady Jaye with their Pacific Northwest twist on American comfort food. It's definitely a gem in the Junction in West Seattle. I never go to West Seattle but I would go out of my way to come out here again for Lady Jaye."

It's hard to settle on one dish to review but the burrata is definitely my favorite even though I was skeptical at first. Hot beans with cold cheese? No thanks! BUT oh my gosh! After the first bite of creamy salty goodness, it's yes please!! Then there's the pork cakes and the mushroom dip with house made chips!! Soooo deelishus.
I'm not usually a fan of crazy cocktails but I love have they pull together a bunch of interesting ingredients and make it work. I have to have a Strawberry Manilow every time I go.
I love the ambiance. The lighting, decor and music make it a place I could hang out all day. It's so comfortable and welcoming.
The staff are hands down my favorite part. They are so excited about their product and even more excited to share it with you and it shows. Everyone I have talked to has been so gracious and humble.
I look forward to every time I get to go. Hmmmm maybe brunch on Sunday???"

How could brisket or a Reuben get any more delicious? Corned pork. So rich and fatty and flavorful. Served on a beautiful cutting board with onion rye, stone ground mustard, a pickle, and house-made sauerkraut. I loved the concept of assembling your own open-faced reubens - ensures nothing gets soggy and each bite has the perfect mix of flavors.
Next time, I want to try the giant turkey let with Mexican fixings (ancho bbq sauce, lime crema, cilantro, etc.) - looked pretty delicious."

I can't think of one thing I would change. We got in around 4 on a Saturday and it was happy hour (yay!) some of their signature cocktails were 2 dollars off and they had food deals. I opted for a Guns and Rosemary gin cocktail and it was delicious! It came with a salted rosemary rim and I was pleasantly surprised that it was not overpowered by the rosemary and it was just the right amount of sweet. I had two of these babies it was too good to switch to something different.
Whoo, okay distracted by how good that cocktail was. Let's talk ambiance. It's a little dim lit but basically the perfect amount to be relaxed. Just being there made me feel cool, it's a little rustic, a little hip, they have a huge chalkboard with the specials written out. What more can you ask for? We were there for a date night and this delivered for a date night mood for sure.
Service was awesome! Our waitress was the perfect amount of attentive while also letting us enjoy our food, drinks and each others company. We never had anything we didn't need and when I annoyingly decided I wanted oysters after we ordered everything else 5 minutes before she was very nice about.
And finally the food! I want to eat here every day. We had 4 oysters on the half shell with a tobasco ice topping that comes on the side. The tobasco Ice wasn't overwhelming and you could still taste the flavor of the oyster. We also had the pork cheek Mac and cheese and pork collar pastrami platter. I was a little hesitant when I saw the mac and cheese had arugula on it but it was heaven. All of the flavors went so well together, now I'm wondering if I should put arugula on my Mac and cheese more often. The pastrami plate was also amazing. It was the fanciest deconstructed rueben I've ever had. The meat was smoky and juicy served with delicious crispy toast, thousand island dressing, mustard, pickles and sauerkraut.
We will be back to try the bologna sandwich."

The staff seemed overburdened. They were very slow to get to us but once they did, it wasn't a long wait for drinks or food.
And then we come to the food. We had two small plates: pesto cream gnocchi and cauliflower with romesco. The gnocchi was heavy, almost pasty, and clunky. The cauliflower was badly over-seasoned with salt, though the texture was pretty good. For dessert, coconut coriander rice pudding with pistachios. The portion was huge (like two cups) but the dish was also a miss. The rice was undercooked so the texture was less like pudding and more like pinhead oats.
Overall, I don't think we'll return."

The smoked tuna toasts were so delicious (I wish every time I made a tuna sandwich it tasted as good as that smoked tuna) with a sweet pepper as a perfect touch on top. The roasted cauliflower was good and flavorful, though admittedly my least favorite item we tried. The pan seared tuna (daily market fish) was expensive at $32 but wow it was flavorful. The sauce on top was tangy, refreshing, and I just couldn't get enough, and the fish had a beautiful crisp to it. The dungeoness crab spaghetti with a lemon butter wine sauce -- wow. Decadent, rich, and delicious with a piece of roasted bread dipped into it. I'm excited to go back and try more. The service could've been a bit faster, but the waiter was friendly and had a lot on his plate (hah)
Update: They now do brunch too! Homemade sweet potato English muffins with their eggs Benedict. The lemongrass braised short rib with kimchi Benedict was stellar and the apple streusel oven baked French toast... wow. The portions are huge so bring a friend to split!"

She was very knowledgeable and very patient in answering all our questions. She paced the meal well.
Unfortunately, only some of the food was great. The coq au vin and short ribs were delicious and well prepared. The fried chicken was wonderfully crispy and well-seasoned.
Some of the food was so-so. The red sauce for the meatballs was better than the meatballs themselves, which were too heavily seasoned with smoked paprika. None of us liked the meatballs, and yet scraped the last bit of sauce from the dish. The brussel sprouts (on the menu since day 1!) were tasty but extremely sweet. The would have been a better dessert than starter. The fries were crispy and hot, but we couldn't taste the black truffle at all. The Caesar salad had nice flavor, but the salt wasn't balanced between the fried capers, croutons, cheese and dressing (overly salty).
We will try it again, hoping the kitchen was having a bit of an off night."

Last time I had the spinach salad with oranges and bacon and added a chicken breast, a winning salad!

They have ciders on rotation and a large selection of wines and beers as well.
Being a vegetarian,we had the artichoke artisan dip and roasted cauliflower for appetizers. The artichoke was the tastiest dip ever ! The cauliflower was a bit soggy but it had a cuminy taste which was good.
My friends also had the shrimp tacos and the seafood spaghetti which they raved on about !
They also have desserts per seasonal changes, we had the lava cake and the lemon strawberry tart. I am a dark chocolate fan, so i loved it. The tart had a subtle sugar taste which suited me.
The service was gracious and couldnt be happier about it ! Will definitely head to this place more often."

I ordered the lamb shank and the meat was falling off the bone and juicy but flavorless. There was a bit of ground mint on top, but not a balancing of flavor, just a smack in the tongue of mint and lame lamb. The sweet potato, brussel sprout, etc... vegetable 'hash' was no hash but a medley of sorts and the flavor on the plate. I ended up eating each bite of lamb with brussel sprout halves to add flavor to meat."

The southwest corn chowder was fabulous (a special, not on the regular menu). The Moroccan lamb was tasty and interesting, with golden raisins and a mix of flavors, and Israeli-style large grain cons-cous. The veggie burger was thick and tasty - we feared it might be simulated meat, but no, it was a proper veggie burger, and quite good. Their list of specialty cocktails is interesting - I had the anejo sour, which was good, if pricey. They also had a good selection of beers (the Seapine IPA on draft was my partner's pick).
All-in-all, we liked The Blue Glass - located downhill of Phinney Ridge on 65th, it's a neighborhood joint with some spizazz. It was a bit pricey ... not outrageous, but more than I would expect for that kind of restaurant."

It's a super cozy little restaurant with a great vibe. There were no children in there which was a godsend! I'm not sure if it's a family restaurant or if it's more of an 'adult only' setting but it was great to eat a meal without having to hear people's children.
Food was 10/10! The short ribs were some of the best I've ever had."

I was encouraged to go for it! -and try the Braised Short Ribs with polenta and sautéed rapini. The ribs practically melted in my mouth! A wonderful dish! Of course I ordered the smoked tuna toasts appetizer again, had to! I took a bite of my friends' Moroccan Lamb and Albondigas, and was in heaven!

It was a short, pleasant walk from our Airbnb. It had a great vibe inside - comfy and iconically picturesque at the same time.
The beer list was fairly extensive, and the beer tasted fresh.
We ordered pan fried brussels sprouts (awesome texture and perfectly cooked, but quite sweet - it could be a dessert), crab fritters (great flavor and super filling) as appetisers. For entrees, I had a Caesar salad with coho salmon (salad was meh and the fish was overcooked) and my wife had the pear arugula salad (good but nothing special).
They could have had an off night this particular Wednesday. Its got awesome ambiance, really good beer, but I would not recommend them for the food."

If you're in search of a restaurant to ""buy out"" for an evening that is a good fit for 50-ish people, definitely give The Blue Glass a look!
James at The Blue Glass worked with us to customize the night to meet our needs. The Blue Glass was flexible on menu and able to accommodate a variety of dietary constraints (including gluten-free and vegetarian). We ended up starting with buffet-style appetizers (Brussels sprouts and Dungeness crab fritters -- both a hit!) and then had plated entrees for the main course. We were able to give our guests the choice of three different entrees (lamb, salmon, and vegetarian risotto) which was great for accommodating various tastes. FYI they have beer, wine, and a full bar available, too.
Size-wise, the restaurant was a perfect fit for our group of 45-50. We filled it up nicely, and when it was time for a few toasts you could easily hear the speakers without needing microphones / audio equipment. (One less logistical item to worry about!) And since we had bought out the whole restaurant for the evening, there were no concerns about toasts disturbing other patrons!
The evening itself went off without a hitch. No delays, no food quality issues, and no worries for me and my partner! Afterwards, a number of guests commented on what a good spot it was for a rehearsal dinner. We would definitely host a rehearsal dinner here again: alas, for us, we hope that is a one-time sort of thing(!) -- so why don't you host yours here, instead?"

This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"

My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."

Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.

Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"

The area around Pike Place is incredible now that the viaduct has been demolished, and I hope local businesses benefit from that. I loved the Zig Zag Café, excellent drinks, good food and great staff. Our server was very friendly and very accommodating when I realized too late that I had ordered something that didn't agree with my tastes. Much appreciated, and I won't wait so long for my next visit!"

We had deviled eggs, the pork skins, and almonds and olives for snacks before dinner at Cutters. The eggplant dip with the pork skins was the highlight. It was silky smooth, and not like baba ganouj, if that's what you were thinking. There's an off-menu cocktail-with-a-story, if you're interested. Called the Chas, it's bourbon, Cointreau, and other potent tastiness. A Pike Place institution, you must come to Zig Zag if you're in Seattle."

The bartenders are the best. They have great listed cocktails and I've had them invent a new cocktail on the fly. If the place isn't super busy, they will interact with you making you feel really comfortable.
The bar is built around the cocktails and the bartenders. The decor is okay for my tastes.
The place can be too small at times so great for a romantic stop but a large party might have to wait for a large table.
If you want more than bar snacks, skip this place but come back after you had food for a great time."

The ambiance is really beautiful and the blue velvet couches/tropical mural are very classy and well-done. However, the drinks didn't especially 'wow' me--the menu is divided up into categories like ""grapes"", ""grains,"" etc. Lots of cognac I noticed! I opted for ""The Fall of Man"" which had sherry in it as well as green apples for a garnish. My friend ordered a drink that had strawberries for a garnish (can't remember what else was in it). We both enjoyed the drinks but for $16 cocktails I guess I was expecting something a bit more memorable.
P.S. They have a $60 off-menu snack which consists of caviar and Bugles. Please order it and tell me how it is!"

Definitely come here for a classy cocktail experience, ambiance is intimate, staff were friendly. Can't speak for the food (yet)."

A great meeting spot for a date or friends who want a masterfully crafted cocktail. Each drink is broken up by the type of spirit and as you go down each list the drink is more ""developed"" or full bodied and more alcoholic. We had the brandy old fashioned and the cab we elope. The old fashioned was a wonderful take on the traditional with great winter taste and spice. Each drink had the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness and alcohol. The bar staff were definitely masters at mixing cocktails and not shy on conversation. Overall a pleasure to enjoy a drink at and will definitely be back."

Belltown has some amazing cocktail lounges already, so Roquette is up against some stiff competition. I might be back for a date in the future, but with Rob Roy, Mr. Darcy's and Branchwater a stone's throw away... maybe not.
The drink I got (think it was called Madame Derrier? Something bitter with whiskey) was indeed amazing, but spendy, even for Seattle. Date's drink was also good. Both were nice 'n' strong. But again, there are tons of great options around.
The inside of the bar is very dark, but somehow missing that coziness I expected. Maybe it was just because it was a sparse night...
The service wasn't great. We sat at a table near the window, away from the bar, and the server kept coming over to us (just have been half a dozen times, maybe more) to ask how we were. Each time, we were fine. I got the impression they wanted us to leave or order another drink or food, and we just didn't need it."

Prices: expensive
Service: shitty, hostile
Bar was empty when we came in. A number of us were meeting up at the bar. Table ran out of chairs so we pulled some of the bar stools for our friends (remember empty bar).
Lady told us we couldn't use the stools because it would block the ""aisle"" and would be a fire hazard. Fine, returned stools.
Friends stood around the table and lady came back and said we couldn't stand around the area because it would still block the aisle and still be a fire hazard. There was a corner area that opened up and she suggested we sit there.
Corner area was large, was not next to any aisle, but still did not have enough seats (poor floor management, there's 8 of us), and bar still empty. We pulled some stools cuz we figured no fire hazard. Lady said she we couldn't use the stools and wanted her stools back.
Friend mumbled a complaint and lady goes on a power trip, flexes that she has the ability to kick us out. We weren't loud, rude, or belligerent to any degree. We barely finished our first round of drinks. Whatever... we decided we didn't want to stay. Slammed our drinks and scrambled to get out of there.

French-Polynesian influence without going the way of a tiki-bar, the drinks are inventive and balanced. The menu will grow with time -- I believe it's been open less than a week -- but I was able to try their 47 Monkey Vesper, the white Negroni, and a TBD spirit-forward Mezcal cocktail (a creation of barman/designer Kyton). Each featured layered flavors that are perfect for the Summer.
Design-wise, the place is intimate but well lit, and the walnut accents and eclectic wallpapers throughout make for a fun backdrop.

Worse yet, when I asked a bartender for a Japanese whisky recommendation, he pretentiously asked about my price range. Now, while I'm no Amazonian tech bro, I'm extremely fortunate enough to have enough disposable income to cover most beverage costs, and having worked as a bartender while in law school, I can assure you that this isn't a common nor acceptable question to ask of patrons. The fact that I was the only non-white person in the bar certainly doesn't help his motivations either..."

It's a nice space to pop in for a pre-or post-dinner drink, chat with a knowledgeable bartender or hang out with a few friends. Not a lot of space for bigger groups and no good way to reconfigure seating. No kitchen so no real food, just some light snacky things. My favorite seats are at the end of the bar in the back or at the short end of the bar counter. Great watching."

Nothing really stood out to me and the cocktails are on the more pricier side for what it is $16-$22. The waitress wasn't that friendly and looked like she didn't want to be there.

I've never been charged gratuity for a place that just served cocktails. I got an old fashion which wasn't bad, but it was hard to overlook that other aspects of the experience."

This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"

My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."

Service from Anna and Erin was spot on a dm fabulous. Technically, I believe Anna was my server yet Erin bought several things and was very attentive as well. It kinda worked as tag team service and that was just fabulous!
All the food was spot on, they had plenty of gluten-free options and the happy hour wine was very good.

Also the cheese just oozed out of everywhere. Very delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my taste though. Score: 5/5
Their snacks were very boring. The baguette with the cultured butter was good though. It comes toasted but my only compliant is that I eat too fast and the outside of the bread is too hard :(
The cheese platter was smelly!!!! It's not my cup of tea but I'm sure other people will love it"

Great cozy restaurant and their service was fantastic. Small selections of wines but they were really good wines and reasonable.
Ordered A charcuterie plate, fried oysters, burgers and mussels. The plate was so tasty and the meats were perfectly cured, their mousse was just melt in my mouth.
Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"

Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"

Definitely a positive experience here. Great food and huge quantities! The menu items are mixed with traditional Thai food you would normally see on any Thai restaurant menus and some modern dishes. I ordered the duck curry and the Pad Thai, they were the ultimate comfort food and the curry was amazing.
Hope to come back soon and try out other dishes."

If it's not cooked like this or has these ingredients, then it's not authentic!
But the more I've been open about trying different fusion/experimental dishes, the more my attitude has just become - if it's good, it's good.
Sisi Kay is a place that I was initially skeptical about. The fancy interior, the fancy drinks, the menu with Tom Yum pizza and Linguini Tom Kha - excuse me?!
But I haven't had any of this before and besides... I was intrigued. And oh-so curious.
I came here with two other friends and we were able to try a number of dishes. We ordered the following...
Spring Rolls: Pretty standard but still good!
Blistered okra: Solid texture and tasty with a good kick.
Soft shell crab salad: I LOVED the texture of the crab in this salad, and such a meaty crab! The salad itself was also great.
Tom Yum pizza: This is exactly how I would expect a Tom Yum pizza to taste. Creative and delicious!
Drunken noodles: Once again, so tasty!
Every dish was a hit and I was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly it's a little pricey, but I wasn't too bothered by that. I am absolutely coming back here to try their Linguini next time!"

The lower area is personally designed for casual dine outs with an open bar that offers a wide variety of drinks (and a happy hour that is soon to be coming!!). The upstairs has a much more formal atmosphere, perfect for a family setting or a romantic dinner for two.
Food comes out hot and delicious in fair time and the flavor is packed in every bite- you can really taste the authentic Thai spices and seasonings. The portions are huge and great to share with friends. Some of my favorite dishes have to include the pad see ew and garlic chicken. The tom yum pizza appetizer is perfect for seafood lovers like me and the fried tofu is also an absolute must. My friends and I finished everything. Would recommend eating here to anyone :-)"

We also tried their new appetizer larb chicken wings and it was actually really good. It had the dressing of larb and the roasted rice powder but with the mini chicken wings which I thought went together really well. Beef pad Seaw also a must try, sweet soy sauce wide rice noodle and Chinese broccoli. Yummy!
Service was nice and prompt and super friendly waiter. They had a little rush when we got in but it seemed like they were able to handle it pretty well with just the two of them. A nice little gem in the Wallingford neighborhood. Can't wait to come back to try their Happy hour!"

The spinach dip was a non-sequitur on an otherwise Thai menu, but was also very good. Fresh spinach with a pleasant but not overwhelming cheese topping, all piping hot, with a good toast accompaniment.
Our entrees were all stellar. They have maintained the May Thai style table side Pad Thai service, along with other Thai classics. All were well done, with fresh ingredients, and the proper level of spice. Portions were generous.
For my midwestern family, this was an excellent intro to what the PNW has to offer in terms of Thai. I will be coming back, and recommend it to anyone. On par with Buddha Ruksa or May Kitchen and Bar."

It was a bit empty when we walked in so we decided to sit out in the patio. We stared at the menu for quite some time as we didn't know what any of the dishes looked like (I'm a visual-kind-of-person). After Googling some dishes and speaking with our server, she suggested the Lamb Ragout Penne Pasta (minus the lamb ragout-vegetarian option) and the Gnocchi. We waited almost an hour for our food, which we weren't too upset about because the chef's wife mentioned that the bread and pasta sauces are all made from scratch. Let me just tell you, THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT. The food came out really hot, but it was delicious! I don't typically like gnocchi, but this gnocchi had a perfect potato ratio. And the penne pasta I had was surprisingly very good. At the end of our meal we were offered a slice of tiramisu, on the house (the chef also made from scratch) for having to wait so long. Tiramisu isn't my first choice when it comes to Italian desserts, but the texture was soft and sweet enough.
Overall, I definitely recommend it! The people were super friendly and the food is delicious."

Their large outdoor seating area (with plenty of shade) was perfect, as was their menu and its execution. I had a yummy smoked salmon with penne pasta. Everyone else loved their choices as well. The owner even included a couple of plates of tiramisu on the house for us to share. So nice of him. I'd love to come back here when in the neighborhood again."

Fresh seafood-all home made
And the chef and wait staff personable and efficient and really nice.
The Tiramisu was to die for and made by the chef owner-- come just for that and you will love it!"

"The Zouave Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-zouave-restaurant-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bobby R.","Ordered ""Penne with vegetables and marinara.""
Pasta was overcooked and soggy. The sauce as watery and insipid.
Not sure why exactly there were green onions in my dish.
Was actually really nice to dine outside 'though, and the sangria was very tasty! Too bad, the food really stunk."
"The Zouave Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-zouave-restaurant-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Patty S.","Absolutely fantastic. New baby at home, birthday...no way we could go out for dinner. Zouave saved us.
Meals were fantastic. I had lamb with gnocchi. One of the best lamb meals i have had. Everyone loved their dinners. Flavors were great. Seasoning was spot on.
Cannot say enough about the staff. I think it was Jason who took my call. Order was perfect. They even threw in a bit extra. I will be going back next time i am down here visiting my daughter.
Thank you so much!"

Can't wait to visit again"
"The Zouave Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-zouave-restaurant-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tian G.","This is a little gem. Their food is full of flavours, and are very uniquely designed - definitely some authentic Italian pastas and entrées. I tried the lobster ravioli with shrimp. The sauce was great! One of the best I have ever tasted. However the lobster ravioli was not very fresh and as someone who is sensitive to the fresh taste of seafood I can tell that it has been keep for a while. The portion was decent, but may not be enough for big appetite. My friends ordered the lamb shank, which was well cooked, soft and soaked in flavoues. The shank has lots of meat. We also ordered their seafood fried rice, which is equally awesome. Their seafood pasta is good, though not spenlendid.
We can see their cheif cooking. It seems there is just one/two people preparing and cooking the food so it takes a while to get our food. They gave free bread as appetizers. We also ordered their tiramisu which I am not a fan of. Overall a solid restaurant."
"The Zouave Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-zouave-restaurant-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Haena K.","The chef and the staff were really nice, and it's a cute place. If you want to eat a home-made meal that you could make (if you had the time, and you are not the best cook)then this is it.
If you are looking for really good eats or you are a foodie, this is not it.
So although I wanted to like this place, since it's a local restaurant with kind staff, I won't be going back.
I feel awful writing such a negative review, but I think it's deceptive for other yelp users to see 4.5. Mioposto got 4 stars when its amazing! There's something really fish going on here! I'm wondering if there are made up reviews on this!!!"
"The Zouave Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-zouave-restaurant-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Omkar W.","I absolutely love this place. Definitely come in the evening and dine outside. I brought two friends, and two of us got the ravioli and the other got the sicilian tortellini. Also, try their soup of the day if you have room. Their service was amazing, and our waiter had the most beautiful, golden voice you can imagine. I'm talking about that deep, sonorous, mellifluous TV talk show host type voice. 10/10 baby."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kayla P.","One of my all-time favorite places in Seattle! The interior is charming and perfect for anything from date night to celebratory dinner. It is a bit small, so I wouldn't bring larger parties here.
The food is incredible! It's authentic and well worth the price. I always get the burrata and fried artichokes to start and finish with the pappardelle alla bolognese. Delicious!"
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Clint W.","hmm, this is the baby to the others and its a cute little place. it's tiny and I admit it felt a little claustrophobic inside, but it had some shoosh to it. it is def cozy and dark inside. it was quite picturesque, people watching on cold evening in the city.
even though we were packed in, I could hear my friend from across the table and we could have a conversation. because it was late, we fired out our orders quickly.
I had spaghetti with guanciale, which I was looking forward to. it had a little bit of heat to it and maybe it was a bit overdone, but it was a solid dish. the menu is a bit small, but I will need to come back."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Chris K.","Nice date night spot. Cozy dark, neighborhoody. We were seated at the bar which is a bit tight but got to watch small kitchen action. Burata was OK nothing to write home about but nice presentation. I had pasta bolognese which is a simple dish and was similarly nicely presented. Friend had gnoochi which was presented in a schooner bowl and seemed quite heavy (he thought it was only ok). Service was friendly. Menu is small which I like.
I'm giving this 3 star not because it was bad, its was as the guide says, OK (virtually everything on yelp is 4 stars given by people who can't boil water). Would I eat here again? Sure. Would I travel across town to eat here? Probably not."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kayesee S.","Wow. I'm so disappointed to lower my rating from 5 stars to 2. I had a pretty terrible experience here my second time. I was so excited to come back here for the second time but left feeling disappointed.
When I sat down at our table, the glass on the table had lipstick on it. I asked for a new glass and got one quickly. It didn't bother me at the time. Mistakes happen.
What was most upsetting is that we never had a server. There was a server helping almost all the other tables, but the bartender took our order and dropped off our food. We never were checked up on or talked too. We even had a reservation so I don't know why we were treated like this. It was really sad because the food is delicious but since we seemed to be the only ones treated like this, it was upsetting. Maybe it was because we were younger than most of the other guests?
Overall the food is delicious, but we left feeling sad and disappointed."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James N.","Brought a date here, and the atmosphere is perfect for that. It is a cozy, small, intimate restaurant, so I recommend you make reservations because there aren't many tables. From the reviews, I was expecting the food to be phenomenal, but it came up a little short. Ordered the fonduta cheese, gnocchi, and fig/prosciutto pizza. Everything was fine, but nothing stood out. To be honest, I've had better pizza at MOD pizza for less than half the price, but I guess you pay for the atmosphere of dining at a cute neighborhood restaurant. The drinks were fine and the service was satisfactory. I parked on the street a block away, at least parking was more plentiful than if the restaurant was located downtown. Overall, I wasn't blown away by anything, I would give this place a 3.5, but rounded up to a 4 to be nice."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","Came here on a Saturday afternoon for early dinner before an early hike the next day. Was not expecting happy hour on a weekend but there was a full happy hour menu. I loved the truffle butter baguette (only $4 on happy hour). The butter was so creamy I ended up putting it on everything (caesar, clams, clam bread etc). We split the spaghetti which was extremely doughy and fresh. Nor a large portion but perfect for us since we had already snacked on apps and wanted to just try a pasta.
We'll be back for sure for the happy hour again and interested in trying the rotating seafood/meat main courses! Good value!"

"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Austin H.","I loved everything about this place. The space was intimate with charming decor. Our server, Jeanine, was extremely kind and helpful throughout the evening. The food was wonderful. To start we got some slightly charred bread with a delicious white truffle butter that we consumed in its entirety. Then came the clams and gnocchi and those were probably my two favorite dishes of the evening. Then the pizza and risotto followed and at this point we were already starting to get full so we took half of each home to make a small amount of room for dessert. It was nice to see sizable and shareable portions. Because we were so full we shared these little nutella stuffed doughnuts with mascarpone and it was a wonderful finishing touch. Next time my family is in town this is a spot I plan on taking them to because of the quality and quantity."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa M.","This has become our favorite special occasion spot in Seattle. The cozy candlelit feeling and warmth from the moment you walk in is so inviting. One experience that has been very representative of the service we've received here; we had a reservation for our anniversary and they were slightly late to seat us, not a big deal or long wait at all - however they went out of their way to apologize and served us complimentary prosecco until our table was ready. Even the wait was fun with how kind they were!
Beyond the service, the food is incredible every. single. time. The rosemary pasta that the bolognese comes with is memorable and a favorite. Their pizzas are also always incredible, the nduja sausage is unique and our favorite for the depth of flavor in the sausage and the crust.
One of the best experiences and meals we've had in Seattle!"

Even when my boyfriend doesn't know how to play with blocks and dumps his pizza all over himself, you save the day and serve up another delicious, homemade gem in its place. I love sitting at the bar by the kitchen chatting about the meal prep, although I wish if you ordered too much baguette from the local boulangerie, you would donate it instead of tossing in the trash. Your cocktails are bomb, service stellar and pizzas amazeballs. Good thing we live closeby otherwise we'd have a huge carbon footprint getting over here.
xxo,

"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Frankie K.","Went here for date night and was very impressed. We got seated in the back of the restaurant in a bar style section overlooking the chefs... and let me just say, I think this was the most coveted seat in the place. During the time we were there we heard multiple come in asking for the seats. As fun as it was to was watch the food being made, we couldn't help feeling awkward!!! What is the protocol here?!?! Are you supposed to talk to the chefs??? They're basically sitting at your table with you.. what do you do?!???
Despite feeling like newbs and not knowing the 'right' way to handle our sitting situation. Everything was perfect. Atmosphere was warm, cozy, and romantic!pizza and pasta were delish. Yummy cocktails. Highly recommend! Just be sure to make reservations- it's a tiny place!"

The first time we went we sat at the bar and got to watch all the food being made. It was awesome. This time we sat at a corner table and it was great too we got the fried artichokes. So good! For dinner I got the crab risotto and my partner got the nduja sausage pizza. Both were fantastic. I think the risotto was a little salty. I think the kitchen was a little heavy handed on salt (even the artichokes were a little salty). The first time we came here that wasn't the case everything was seasoned perfectly. For dessert we got the zeppole. Such a great restaurant and becoming a favorite of ours!"

Small seasonal menu, Food is always good, the staff is so nice and it's just a cute space with indoor and outdoor seating! I prefer the space during the summer where you can sit outside and they have all the doors open because it can get a little hot inside since the kitchen is right there at the bar and it's such a small space so I usually don't like to sit at the bar."

( owner, if you're listening, putting in some ceiling noise dampeners would be sooo appreciated )
I've walked by and stared into the windows here many a times wishing to check it out. I had high expectations based solely on the cuteness factor. Finally got a chance to go and expectations were met and then some. We shared two starters, a serving of bread and one main entree. Not to mention a fancy ass bottle of Delille D2 DELICIOUS wine.
We had the cauliflower and the beef carpaccio starters. The beef carpaccio was beautiful to look at and beyond tasty. Like beyond. I could have easily had 5 more plates of it. It's not huge but it's a flavor bomb. The cauliflower was seasoned and prepared perfectly, and I don't really even like cauliflower. The rustic bread was happily smothered by me with the truffle butter that came along with it. Our finale was the spaghetti. Best spagetti, ever. Perfect homemade noodles, amount of sauce, meat chunks and adorned with the best mound of freshly grated parmesan cheese and herbs. Heaven.
When I go back, I need to try the bolognese next.
Shout out to Hugo, for his recommendations, his appropriate loud voice and his patience with me and my wine sampling and food allergy self."
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stephanie H.","We originally intended to come for restaurant week, not realizing that RW menu is only Sunday through Thursday (rookie mistake), but it actually worked out really well for us! We chose to explore some items that weren't on the RW menu and had a great experience. The place was still bustling at 8 PM (we had a reservation). Staff are super friendly and all-around great.
We were seated at what is essentially the chef's counter and had front-row seats watching the chef/owner cook. I was super impressed watching him cook for the whole restaurant in this tiny kitchen on a four-burner electric stove and being able to see the process made the food taste even better.
Food was delicious. We started with the clams, which were in a piping-hot, very mildly spicy tomato-based sauce. The picci amatriciana was, to quote my BF, the best tomato-based pasta he's had in the past couple of years. Seared scallops were also very good. Overall a great experience. Bar Cantinetta is a true neighborhood gem and I will definitely be back!"
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carla R.","The arancini and papardelle were so spicy that minutes after eating each, my mouth was on fire. I've had the papardelle before and it wasn't like this at all. I'm very sensitive to heat (spice) and nowhere on the menu was this change noted or listed. I would not have ordered it if I had known. Too bad, this dish used to be good, but it was so hot I couldn't even taste it. Really disappointed. Won't be back. Consistency matters, as do accurate descriptions. There's no need for arancini or papardelle bolognese to have that level of kick, definitely not what is expected or wanted."
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joel C.","Our experience at Bisato was amazing!! We were a four top and shared all plates. The Burrata was on of the most beautiful dishes I've ever seen. But then came the gnocchi, the yolk ravioli, and the ragu--Each so beautifully crafted, plated, and served. The flavors of these dishes were both familiar and completely new in the way they were prepared. I couLd not have told you what I was eating keg, but each item--each component--was so delicious and perfect together.
The service was impeccable. Just impeccable.
We started With the salumi. Ridiculously thinly sliced and delicious. We ate way too much focaccia b/c it was delicious and B/c the olive oil was the best we've had.
We cannot wait to go again!!!"
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","J Y.","Loved our experience at Bisato! Yes it is small portion but every dish was prepared perfectly.

"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Deane S.","This has to be one of the finest restaurants in Seattle. Each course was perfectly executed. The ingredients married perfectly and were exquisitely plated. We had our server pair wines with each course and he nailed it!

"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alice W.","It's hard for me to rate this place bc we maybe ordered wrong... everything we got was incredibly heavy or creamy that halfway through 2 (of 4) of us had to stop eating and let our counterparts finish the meal and we had to cancel a part of our orders.
We partook in:
- Salumi: incredibly delicious and beautifully, thinly cut. probably my fave of the evening.
- octopus: the octopus and the accompanying ice cream thing were delicious but I wasn't a fan of the hot pepper paste that came w it. Reminded me of Korean gochujang (hot paste) and there was a bit too much of it.
- foie gras: I had to ask for extra bread to eat this since this stuff is pretty fatty/greasy. Standard foie gras. I liked the sauce that came w it. Good balance.
- scallops (3): this was also quite Easy to eat and share since the scallops were pretty large in size
- savory fish tart w 3 minute egg and salmon roe: this was a bit too much for me and we got 2 to share amongst 4 people. If we could've done it again, we would've only gotten 1 to share bc this is super heavy, rich, and creamy. This was yummy tho for the first 2 bites but I had to stop after that.
- Dungeness crab: probably the lightest dish we had. Came w shredded crab meat in a pretty little tower of thinly sliced honey crisp Apple. Perhaps the best paired dish we got bc everything before and after was super heavy.
- gnocchi: the gnocchi is actually pretty large in size. Only comes out as 1 gnocchi but it can be shared. Again, this came w the hot paste that was reminiscent of Korean hot paste...
- tagliarini noodles: this was a bit of a let down. It comes w saffron noodles I think, lemon grass, and uni. We were told by our server to have it mixed, but I wish we didn't mix it. The lemongrass was overpowering and you couldn't taste the uni at all. Also, throughout the rest of the evening at dinner and home, we burped lemongrass.
Hand pasta: this is a wide, thin piece of pasta. It was super salty. Thankfully this came out w the veal chop which was not very seasoned, so eaten together they balanced each other out. But overall a bit of a let down.
- veal chop: this came out wo any accompaniments, so it was literally just a plate of sliced veal and the bone. Not salty enough, so pairing it w something salty or a veggie is a good choice.
Hmmm.... I think the food was okay, but either too seasoned or not seasoned enough.
Also, our server advised us to get 3-4 dishes per person, which I definitely think was too much. I think that would've made more sense if we were guided to get a well-balanced meal w light elements and rich elements, but we were not informed on what would be super heavy vs. what would pair well together. Everything we got was super heavy so it ended up being a hard meal for us to eat, plus we ended up canceling a portion of our orders bc it got so heavy halfway through. They didn't have a tasting menu when we went bc they said they were ""in between"" a transition or something.
The ambiance is lovely though, the coat check is great, and the open concept of the kitchen is cool. Def a cute date spot or place to grab a drink, but I wish they helped us balance our meal better w suggestions, which I'm pretty used to at other restaurants esp at this price point."
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christy K.","This is a late review, as I went for a dinner back in early August. It was for our anniversary celebration, just the two if us. We went on a recommendation from a friend. It was an amazing experience. The service was one of the best I've had in a long while. Attentive, very polite and respectful, and not intrusive at all. They answered all questions and helped us decide on a perfectly delicious wine. They were quite concerned because a light bulb above us kept flickering. They offered to move us, but we hadn't noticed it at all so decided it wasn't necessary.
We had just recently decided on becoming pescatarian, and there were plenty of delicious options for us. We tried 7 dishes, as I had done my research. In many reviews people had complained that the dishes were too small and they had left hungry. So I decided to order plenty. And we ordered more than enough as we both left very content, almost too full. Each dish, as you can see in the photos, was a work of art! Almost too good to eat! The service staff were very kind and explained each dish. I loved each one. Enjoyed all the flavors, and we didn't leave any leftovers. I can't remember which were my favorites as it has been too many months since my visit. But I remember that the whole experience was excellent. We left happy and very impressed. I HIGHLY recommend this place."

"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jason P.","Never got to try the original Bisato before it closed in 2012, but now that it reopened again, I so glad I got to try out the restaurant. Its an other amazing fine dining addition to the Seattle food scene, definitely not for everyone, but for those that are looking for a extra special meal for a celebration this is a great choice for it.
The location of Bisato is in a darkish corner of pioneer square with street parking available, if hard to get on a busy night. Walking inside, its an amazing space, it modern and inviting, not the standard industrial like space of most Seattle restaurant. There is a bar area that doesn't currently serve food, as well as table seating for what looks like 50 people. There is a great bright open kitchen that they invite you to look into, but the rest of the restaurant is fairly dark.
I went the tasting menu, though was very tempted by the chef choice option for an unknown price. The highlight of the meal for me was ravilolo filled with ricotta and a egg yolk, seems simple but everything about it was perfect. The chef even came by to serve it and cut the ravilolo to let the egg yolk spill out. Definitely a lick the plate kind of dish. Everything was very inventive, never would imagine a combination of crab and apples, or a scallop carpacio with salami. The dishes on the small side, even the a la carte option, so you are going to be spending quite a bit, but it totally worth it for me.
The service was great, they constantly was checking in on me, the water was always refilled, and the described all of the dishes well. The chef was always walking around and interacting with the guest, had a really cool conversation with him."

As a long time Seattleite I was fortune enough to dine at Chef Scott Carsberg's Lampreia and the original Bisato at 1st Avenue & Battery in Belltown numerous times; both world class restaurants! I am really excited that Bisato has re-opened in Pioneer Square (84 Yesler Way)!
The interior is warm and inviting with an open kitchen to watch the chef at work! And what a sight as you watch the kitchen staff work over an array of beautiful cured meats on the counter separating the restaurant from the kitchen. It opened in February and I have eaten there numerous times. Anything that the chef prepares is going to be an event. He adds new items to the menu on an almost daily basis, but also has some of his classics from his previous restaurants. And the service is world class!
It will be great for the neighborhood, but I think it will also be a destination restaurant for those seeking world-class cuisine!
Great to have you back Chef!!!!!"
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Drew S.","Several hours after enjoying a great meal at Bisato tonight, I just now realized what makes this new restaurant one of the most unique & interesting fine dining experiences in the PNW: it's a rare mélange of old school charm & attentive service mixed with some of the most modern, creative dishes I've seen/devoured in a long time.
The staff preparing and serving these artistic dishes are obviously very serious about what they do; but you can tell they also find joy in the collaborative effort.
We ordered about 12 dishes off the menu tonight, and all were fantastic. The real standout for me was the fish - in this case Bass served with Pistachio nuts and some fancy raisins.
A nice glass of Chianti and some crazy good chocolate tart helped seal the deal.
I can't wait to come back and try everything else!"
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kate C.","Absolutely amazing experience. The service was done with precision, from the moment we stepped in the door. The attention to detail in every aspect of the decor, utensils, glassware was a wonderful compliment to show off the amazing dishes.
We enjoyed several items Chef Carsberg had on the menu (soft opening): hamachi crudo, radicchio salad, gnocchi, truffles pasta sheet, short rib, chocolate mousse and a surprise extra dessert (ice milk with chocolate soup).
I am still dreaming of the short rib, hamachi, both pasta dishes and the desserts.
Seattle is lucky to have Chef Carsberg back, leading a very talented team. I can't wait to come back after the official opening!"
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bennett L.","The food and service were wonderful. We tried the ""Cook for Me Carsberg"" omakase-style dinner, which came out to around $200 per person for nine courses. We felt that this was a great way to sample everything that the restaurant and chef had to offer, and we were blown away by the creativity exhibited in the dishes, as well as the exquisite and choreographed service. However, the dinner was very seafood-heavy, so we would not recommend for those with an aversion - although I'm not sure if this is intentional, or if it changes around the year. They are also very accommodating when it comes to dietary restrictions, so perhaps seafood allergies would have resulted in an entirely different meal.
The dining space felt very modern, and the open kitchen design allowed for guests to see their food being prepared - a nice touch. The restaurant itself isn't large by any means, but this resulted in a more personal atmosphere, and it was clear from the arrangement of the kitchen to the display of open and constantly-shifting beverages on central tables that this is meant to evoke a feeling of being at a dinner party.
Chef Carsberg stopped by our table several times over the course of the meal to check on how we were enjoying things, and even allowed us to enter the open kitchen afterwards for a quick conversation and picture with him, also making a point to ask for feedback on the dinner. Thus, a great meal culminated in an even more memorable experience."
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Asasia C.","Great new restaurant! My husband and I randomly decided to stop in and give it a try. My husband had the tasting menu and I opted for a la carte. I appreciated that the whole table did not have to participate in the tasting menu. We enjoyed every dish. Some highlights included the wagyu beef special, dungeness crab with apple, and the gnocchi, and meat ragu with purées potato. The chocolate mousse with orange confit was also delicious. Service was great - attentive but not overbearing. We will definitely return soon!"
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","John R.","We brought two out of town guests (Tucson and Chicago) to Bisato last night - the former Trattoria Mitchelli location, but the interior improvements are nothing like the old TM. A beautiful space, with the open kitchen divided from the main dining area by a counter filled with beautiful cured meats. The service, from start to finish, was impeccable. I liked our server's style, but at times his desire to inform us felt a little pushy. I am not a fan of being told ""you should order.."", but it was low key. I also found it a little confusing to have so many off-menu items that he explained, but they got a bit lost in the lively atmosphere. This is a ""hard surface"" space, so my personal hearing issues can result in me losing a lot of the detail from a soft-spoken server.
Service of the food was top notch. All plates were set simultaneously and without any mix-up in who ordered what. Likewise, finished plates were quietly whisked away when we were done.
Food quality was amazing. Everything was perfectly prepared, artful presentations, original flavor combinations and a treat for palette and eye. We had a lot of fun sharing small tastes with each other. Portions are reasonable, maybe running small for big eaters, but Bisato is not about the volume of food one can consume. We tried the bass, steak and marinated black cod and everyone loved their food. The ""hit"" was the gnocchi - a nice fat dumpling topped, atop and aside many other creative ingredients and flavor pairings. The other hit for me was the asparagus soup - a bowlful of the taste of spring!
For us, having a fine dining establishment in Pioneer Square as an alternative to Il Terrazzo is wonderful. We can walk there from our office and we plan on entertaining more clients and business contacts soon. I am pretty sure Chicago and Tucson will know about this restaurant as our business contacts are sure to talk it up. The dress, by the way, is Seattle casual - no pretense here."

"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jayme G.","Bisato is my jam! I had the chance to dine at Bisato several years ago in the old location and fell in love with it then. So I was really excited when I learned that it was coming back. Actually, I was worried that it might not live up to what I remembered. But having been a couple of times now in the new location I can say it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The new space is gorgeous. The service is refreshingly great (somehow low key but still exceptionally informed and attentive). And the food always astounds, which is not at all a surprise as the chef is never not there. This is my new favorite Seattle restaurant.
I've been really fortunate to have traveled extensively for work in Europe and Bisato always strikes me as one of the most authentically European dining experiences I've ever had in the US bar none. It's hard to explain but there is a tradition of respect for ingredients and food that is so apparent in the food here. It's interesting though to look through the reviews and to see a few who just don't get it. Which doesn't really surprise me because this guy is cooking as if his life depended on it and most people aren't used to that. It's like he's using a whole different language of cooking. This chef is old school but manages to make the food surprising and new at the same time.
This food is about ingredients and flavor, not about heaping, torso-sized American portions. It seems to assume that after you've had several bites of something your taste buds acclimate to those flavors and it doesn't surprise anymore. So why not finish it up and move on to the next thing that is going to dazzle you?! I've never left Bisato hungry so I don't understand some of the smack talk here. If you leave this place hungry then you're doing it wrong. Order more food! You won't be sorry. There is not a better value in restaurant dining in Seattle - no - America....than having this guy cook for you! We'll be going back often."

They have draft Stove Brewing. They actually brew next door to the restaurant as well. The staff is so kind. It was fun to talk to Bruno the owner. And his apprentice Marcus was awesome! Bruno gave me a pistachio macaroon with my beer! It was so freaking delicious. There was still a little sweetness but nice and light.
I didn't get any food because had just eaten. But the beer and macaroon was yum! I really love their remodel as well. It puts the whole place together. Also they have a new state of the art pizza oven. It can cook pizza in like 12 seconds. Something crazy like that. Of course I'm exaggerating. Definitely go try out it!"
"Pizza and Pasta Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-and-pasta-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Christina C.","Really interesting concept of Pizza and Pasta bar where you can get quick cooked meal for price of the restaurant food. We payed $45 for lunch meal (ouchhhh) My husband took chicken pesto penne pasta and I took lobster ravioli. His pasta was OK but chicken was extra $3 and it tasted like warmed leftover chicken.I didn't had high expectations for lobster ravioli at this place but since its my fav dish I decided to try. Pasta dough was horrible, it was undercooked and lobster meat inside tasted like this pasta that you buy at the supermarket. I am big fan of Italian food and I traveled a lot across the Italy and I am sorry I cant call it Pasta. For a counter service restaurant, I think the prices are way too high. Parmesan cheese containers in every table, and they were all empty (PS its not a real parmesan cheese). This counter service restaurant its overpriced.
Dear Owner,
Thank you for your advice but I don't need to be pointed out where I may or may not eat. I am free to eat anywhere I want or say HOW I felt about my experience. My review was honest and many people wrote the same thing- its overpriced, empty cheese containers, bad service, tasteless pasta. I didn't said anything about bad service but after your response I don't think you can take honest critics to improve your business. Seems I am not only one who got a rude response from the owner (you tell people they are welcome not to come back/eat somewhere else). Many people who were honest that they didn't like something got an unpleasant message from You. My 3 stars were not a bad review but room to improve because my husbands pasta tasted OK but mine was completely undercooked. I don't want to talk about heritage and compare who knows the best. My point was that I (personally) can't call it pasta and it's my opinion. Unfortunately some people can't take the constructive criticism."

Service: The man at the counter kept on messing up our order even though we only ordered 4 slices. First he claimed that my friend only ordered one and wanted to charge her again for a second slice even though she clearly already paid over $14 for two slices. Then he kept on forgetting who ordered what even though half their pizza options were unavailable and we simply ordered 2 cheese slices and 2 meat lover slices. Though we clarified with him 3 times, he STILL tried to give me a cheese slice though I ordered meat lovers.
Price: $6 for cheese, $7 for anything else, +$0.50 for using card if your order is under $10 -- with tax my single slice was over $8, which is enough to get an entire pizza at MOD!
Food: Taste was mediocre at best and now my friend and I feel very unwell. I feel very queasy and dizzy. I will never come here again -- definitely do NOT recommend!"

Sparkling water is something this place has. They even had blue power aide too. The pizza choices were pretty simple. This is the good news.
This place did not customize orders and the woman/cashier was not the friendliest of people I met. She greeted us, but could not seem to keep her attention on her guest who were ordering food.
The pizza was decent, but not the best pizza I have tasted. I did not see any plastic utensils and trying to get the woman's attention again to ask did not seem appealing. The Male manager pretty much had the same attitude as the woman.

My slice of pepperoni pizza took about 15 minutes to come out on a Saturday afternoon, and when it arrived I was shocked at how small and meager it appeared (good size for a my five-year-old god son). The flavor was decent but overall nothing special. They also charge 50 cents for purchases under $10 so this child-sized slice of mediocre pizza came out to just over $7. I would not return. There are many better places a stone's throw from here."

I had their pasta cacio e pepe, and my husband had the butternut squash ravioli with pesto. For a counter service restaurant, I think the prices are way too high. The cashier was not very friendly at all, either. The food was just okay. You have to pay extra for things like $3 for pesto with your ravioli... that's a bit much.

It was rich, yet easy to eat. Usually if the sauce is too strong, people get sick of it. But their sauce was delicious and I had no problem finishing the whole plate of pasta. They also sprinkle parmesan cheese on top which adds a nice finish to the pasta. The sausage was pretty standard, nothing special but nothing bad either. I would totally recommend trying this spot out if you want to avoid the crowds at Pike Place. The owner/workers are really friendly too!"

When it showed up it looked really good. I took a few bites, and it tasted as good as it looked. Unfortunately, when I set the sandwich down, I noticed multiple hairs in the food. I pulled them out of the sauce. When I contacted the restaurant, the manager or owner basically said it wasn't his fault and insinuated that he didn't believe me. He did offer to replace the item and add a complimentary dessert, but wouldn't accept responsibility for the mistake, and continued to insinuate that I was lying. I turned down the replacement and was refunded by Grubhub. Their customer service and being called a liar is enough to keep me from ever returning."

"Pizza and Pasta Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-and-pasta-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Ciara U.","Came here since the entire time I was in Seattle, I was craving Spaghetti. First thing I noticed was this place was empty. There was a woman, man and young man working. Next thing I noticed was their prices.... $18 for spaghetti at a hole in the wall. WTH?!?! But I really wanted it so I ordered it. They had a special that day and it was $15 for it so I saved $3 bucks. My mom was with me but wasn't planning on ordering since we all were getting different places she wanted to nibble on everything. The lady (who I believe was also an owner) charged me a $3 split fee?!?! WTH. I wasn't splitting it and I wasn't eating in either. My mom kinda handled that situation and the lady took off the $3 but was very rude and not personable at all. After my spaghetti and 2 drinks it came out to damn near $30. $8 for two 16oz soda? Geez. While the young man was cooking my food I asked for it to go Incase they didn't realize. But I noticed on the menu that they charge you for boxes! What in the world. Never have I ever been to a restaurant or take out place where you get charged for a box. That's just greedy and unnecessary. The young man was very nice and so was the man who I believe is also an owner. But that lady needs to be thrown in the back where no one can talk to her until she learns how to be polite. The spaghetti however was very delicious and it's probably the only reason for the star. Despite the tiny portion for the price, It had great flavor & tasted authentic. The salad was gross and the garlic bread was decent. Definitely not worth $18.
Trust me... don't do it!"

See Naples and die - or just trot over to Rainier Beach and have an authentic southern Italian pie!
According to their website, Pulcinella is brought to you by the same folks who own and operate Vince's. And, it has been ""certified Neapolitan"" by the Verace Pizza Napolitana Association since 2009.
The pizzeria is in a rustic building with high ceilings and expansive windows. The restaurant has a cozy feeI with table and bar seating, as well as a pizza counter where I grabbed a front row seat.stopped in on a rainy Wednesday night and was greeted by a friendly and helpful staff.
At the recommendation of Leo, the pizza maker, I decided on the Italian sausage and bell peppers appetizer ($10), which is given a brief roasting in the pizza oven and served in the cast iron skillet. Tasty, and the red sauce was hearty and flavorful.
Completing my order was the Giovanni pie - roasted pepper & pesto sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, onion, crimini mushrooms, fresh tomatoes.
My server explained they would wait to put in the pizza order, because it bakes in just 90 seconds - and they weren't kidding. In fact, Leo, pointed out that part of their certification is a requirement to bake their pies to the 90 second mark - and - not a second more!

They make each pizza per order and they use fresh ingredients. The staff is nice and they have a lot of options to choose from. It has a very rustic pizza parlor feel and the dark wood interior and accents give it a real Italian vibe.
I got the Pozzuoli and when I tell you I inhaled this pizza I'm not lying. I don't even think it made it to the 5 minute mark. The crust was the perfect and there was not too much sauce on the pizza. The pepperoni was fresh and so were the mushrooms. It had the perfect bite and the pizza crust was good too. I have nothing negative to say about this place.

Best thing about the food was 1) the pizza dough/crust 2) pepperoni, it's like seasoned or something but super good! We also tried the lasagna which was good with the ground meat being the highlight. I do still enjoy the pizza more though so I'd return for more of that. The weird thing to me was the middle of the pizza was super soggy.

We went on Friday night and got there about 7:30 pm. The restaurant was packed. The only available seating was at the bar, which I thought was perfect. It sat us in front of the kitchen and it was the best view in the house.
The staff was very friendly and was attentive to us. We started with the Caesar salad, meatballs with marinara sauce and foccacia bread. Everything was great. We could have just been happy with ordering just that and dessert. But we also had to try the pizzas.
The timing of when our pizza came out to us was perfect. After we finished our appetizers, we didn't wait too long for it to arrive. It gave us enough time to digest our food. We ordered the Margherita and Diavola. The pizzas look amazing. I loved the taste, ingredients and the crust. I'm not a big fan of Margherita pizza, but this one was great tasting and I liked it very much. I love the spicy olive oil and the pepperoni in the Diavola pizza. The owner came to talk to us after our meal. We told him it was our first time and everything was great.
For dessert, we got the mocha decadence cake. It was amazing! Yuuuuuummmm.
I would definitely come back and bring my sister here, who's been to Italy, and see what she thinks.

Okay, now that I have your attention, I'll take it down a notch, although, I really shouldn't because they deserve as much;)
My husband lived in Italy for a few years while serving in the Navy and really fell in love with the food and the culture there. So while I was casually surfing Yelp I came upon this place, and the reviews that kept referring to its Italian authenticity. I knew I had to bring him here.
Like many others stated before, the place is on the small side. And parking can be a little rough. We got there at 7pm on a Friday night and it was busy. We ended up parking on the street next to the restaurant, it really wasn't that big of a deal. It definitely doesn't look like much on the outside, but you can tell with how paced it is, that its gotta be something special.
We went in and every table was taken. There were two spots at the bar that face into the open kitchen and we were totally fine with that. Gave us something fun to watch while we were waiting for our food. My husband was instantly in heaven once we were seated and we could take it all in. The decor, the set up, everything was ""spot on"", says he.
Our server was quick to greet us and get things started. We both got a glass of wine. I chose mine based upon a prior Yelp reviewers Tip by Greg B who said to try the ""Montepulciano D' Abruzzo"" and WOW did that not disappoint! A nice wine, full of flavor. My husband got the Chianti because thats his favorite. He really enjoyed it. It was a bit too light for my tasting.
For dinner we got the Giovanni per all of the recommendations on Yelp. I think is was between that or the Diavola (which had a bunch of good reviews as well) but we just decided on the Geo and it was GREAT! Not to mention we timed it and I think it was 90 seconds it took from the pizza to go from the oven to our plates. Incredible! Easily the best and most authentic pizza we have had.
We finished off with some Spumoni which was again, delicious.
Truly everything here tasted heavenly. The food comes out fast so I can see how tables can be turned quickly, unless you have people wanting to stay and chat. But its well worth the wait! I hope that they open up another location, because it would really do well!
We will definitely be back again and again!"

Crust was perfect and so were the ingredients. I got a margarita pizza with mushrooms. Wonderful. Also split a pear and Gorgonzola salad and split a Spumoni for dessert. If your looking for pizza in Seattle, search no more and just indulge and skip the diet for a day. You deserve it!"
"Pizzeria Pulcinella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-pulcinella-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy I.","Good quality ingredients but soggy crust and skimpy on the basil for the margarita base pizza. The basil had some big pieces on one slice then a couple of others were more stem than leaf. Cute place and liked the white table wine, it was inexpensive but a good Pinot Grigio. Just not holding up to other Italian style pizzas in town.
Nice they have reservations since it is a small place and very popular. Not worth the drive for us since again some better options out there closer to home."

I was immediately skeptical when I saw only red onions on the menu. I still have it a try. Let me say the flavor is great. It's the pizza making skills that are horrible. When I pulled a slice from box there was so little cheese on the pie all the toppings fell off. I also ordered green peppers and ended up with red roasted peppers. The hunt continues for good pizza on the West Coast"

We've only been one time and gotten take out one time but tried a variety of options. The meatballs were tender and well seasoned and come with a huge cup of delicious marinara...save that sauce for your pizza! Salads were fresh and tasty and served a few people at our table. Dressing is light which I prefer and appreciate. We tried three pizzas and all were good. Crust is delicious! The potato pizza was surprisingly delicious and unique. They have the nutella calzones here too, which are always a good idea but we passed this time around. Next time!!!
Baby friendly and very friendly staff. I thought their prices were fair for the quantity and quality."

This a a warm and inviting place starting with a friendly greeting when you walk in. The atmosphere along with decor really does remind me of some of the little restaurants in the Italian countryside. Obviously the designer has been there before. It was cool how they make the pizza right on the counter close to customers. I enjoyed watching the show from the stretching of the dough to the final product. After that, the pizza arrived in all its glory following a delicious house salad. The the Diavola arrived and it reminded me of my time in Naples. I'm coming back here to try the rest of the menu."
"Pizzeria Pulcinella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-pulcinella-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Philicia S.","After years of driving by, never really pushing myself to come, I'm glad I finally did tonight. We arrived around 8:30pm on a Friday evening. Quite a bit of tight parking, we walked in and it was about 85% full, loud with a hustle and bustle of what looks to be locals and regular diners.
The moment you walk in, you smell that fresh pizza dough and toasted pizza crust scent lingering in the air. You are then greeted by a friendly smile at the host stand. You give them your party count 2 + 2 kids. They ask if we are interested in 2 crayon sets and we say yes!
we got sat on a half booth, half chair table. and menus are set in front of us and the host brings by some ice waters. as we gaze around, there are lots of interesting things placed on the walls. wine bottles and glasses, little antique looking things here and there.
we were then greeted by a sweet server, we let her know it was our first time and if she could explain the food, etc. here to us. which she happily did, she informed us of the size and what they recommended. we needed more time to browse so we talked amongst ourselves and looked closely at their menu.
We eventually decided on 2 appetizer salads. 3 pizzas and 2 drinks.
Their version of supreme #13 I believe and I got #7 and added anchovies, we got our kids a marinara based pizza with pepperoni and cheese. We started off with their arugula salad and caesar. When the server dropped it off. she brought along a plate of focaccia bread as well and offered us fresh ground pepper.
The salads were amazing. so fresh and crisp. tangy and simple dressing on the arugula salad with shaved parmesan. the caesar with housemade dressing was delicious. just absolutely perfect.
Our pizzas were yummy. lovely toasted fresh brick over pizza. super thin crust. My husband supreme pizza, was loaded with toppings that were a little overwhelming and hard to eat off the pizza since all the toppings kept falling off. My pizza the number seven with anchovies was really good it was simple, and very refreshing with arugula on top. It was a little bit too salty for me I should have not added the anchovies, but I did enjoy the pizza itself it was really different from anything I've had in Seattle.
We went ahead and ordered a soda and a raspberry Italian soda, the Italian soda was good it wasn't too sweet and just the right amount of syrup and cream ratio. Our soda was refilled. As soon as we needed it.
Eventually we were done, we definitely could not finish what we ordered, but we love having leftovers, so yay for us! We did end up ordering dessert and we got their cannoli. The cannoli was really good, it wasnt too sweet, and just the perfect amount of crunch, to finish off a delicious meal.
Server was great the whole time we got cashed out and never had to wait too long for anything. It was a really great first experience and we will definitely be back again, I just wish I pushed myself to try it sooner because now I feel like I made myself deprived all these years."

I don't know where to start!
Immediately, we felt at home and welcomed as it was our first time here. My friend was from Spain visiting and she has been to Italy many times. She couldn't stop talking about this fun and decadent experience after it was all over. We will definitely be back!!
The delight of the experience is that you don't know what's coming out but you can tell them what you prefer. The courses that came out were so amazingly good and unique in flavors to one another that it kept our pallets dancing and guessing our next adventurous bite.
The service was very attentive and warm. I'm pretty needy when it comes to water refills FYI and I was never left thirsty. They explained each meal as it arrived and the whole experience was a delight! Thank you so much!!
We mistakenly stuffed our faces on the first 2 courses so we got so full by the time the main course arrived. It was so good!! They packed the left overs in to go containers very well and made it easy for us to enjoy it later. Thank you!!"

Like someone's living room, or a restaurant that has recently closed. Papers scattered over the big desk right when you walk in and really old scratched glass wear from years of stacking.
Service was pretty nice
Food was not good this time. The garlic was so burnt on the carbonara I couldn't eat it. Pancetta seemed a bit old too. The owner asked if I wanted it remade which is cool, but I didn't feel like having anymore of that rich dish again. We got sick to our stomachs after eating the margarita pizza. All night. On New Year's Eve. It just seemed like the ingredients were cheap or stale. Garlic bread was cheap. For $2 a serving tho what can I expect.
Place needs an overhaul"

As others have noted, the hostess, was sitting a table that had paperwork and iced coffee cups, but I hadn't eaten all day and decided to stay. Be warned, this place is no nouvelle cuisine...they do not have signature cocktails or cocktail menu....rather it's like eating in someone's home..they offer what they have. That being said, the food was amazing. The salad was fresh with homemade dressing, large enough for two! My entree, was huge and the pasta was cooked to al dente perfection! The chicken parmigiana was one of the best I've ever had.

"Luigi’s Italian Eatery","https://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-italian-eatery-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Cara L.","It's been a while since we've stopped in to this local, Italian restaurant. And I feel like it honestly might be my last time, unfortunately.
I'm at 2.5 stars right now. It sucks because I really want to like this place so much. And it isn't that the food is terrible, either. The portions can be on the small side, but their cream-based pastas and their carbonara are consistently good. However, about half of their menu items are hit or miss.
We stopped in recently on a Saturday afternoon to grab a late lunch and the place was pretty empty. We were seated at a table that had water all over it from the pitcher there for us to refill. Menus were placed on our table and we were asked right away if we wanted drinks. We asked for a drink menu and the waiter told us he ""was the drink menu."" Okay? How am I supposed to know what to order if you have no indication of what cocktails, wine, and beer you offer? I asked for a red wine and so did my fiance. The waiter then immediately asked us if we were planning on having more than one glass and if we wanted a carafe instead. We stupidly said yes without any mention of price or size. $32 later for house wine and I'm a little pissed that there was no mention of price from the waiter after he offered, ESPECIALLY since they have no drink menu.
We then ordered our food and while we waited, we noticed the the staff was sitting around for 75% of the time we were there. It seems weird that a restaurant's staff would just be chillin' on a Saturday. Any restaurant or bar I've ever worked in there was ALWAYS something to do and there was NEVER a reason to be sitting around. When our food was dropped off, I was bummed that my ragu was bland. But my fiance liked his carbonara.
When we got our check I was shocked to see that 1) a carafe of house wine is $32 and they don't tell you that and 2) there is a 20% SERVICE CHARGE. And not just for large parties, but even for 2 people dining--no matter how the service you received was, or how the food was... I'm not kidding. There is no signage or warning of this anywhere in the restaurant that I saw. As someone who worked in the service industry from a long time, I'm a big tipper. But what they're doing here at Luigi's is absolutely unacceptable.
It's because of this I will not return."

"Luigi’s Italian Eatery","https://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-italian-eatery-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Sebastian T.","I came here as I had an opportunity to try the margherita pizza with mealpal. This restaurant is actually a venue that teaches cooking classes as well! I came in at 1:30pm on a weekday and there was noone in the restaurant and the owners were sitting at one of the tables, and planning out the cooking classes for later in the day.
The margherita pizza was really meh. The cheese to crust ratio was off, there was simply too much. Additionally, there was a fair bit of italian seasoning in the crust/under the cheese that threw me off, but overall it contributed to the dish. But this did turn out way too oily, probably due to the excessive amount of cheese. The cheese ended up flowing between each slice of the pizza where it was cut, if that paints a picture.
I'd come back and try the pasta dishes one day, but i'll definitely be avoiding the pizza in the future. I recommend coming here at least once to check it out! It has a warm family owned welcoming vibe."
"Luigi’s Italian Eatery","https://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-italian-eatery-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Harpreet K.","DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE RUDE AND SHITTY SERVICE
We were craving for some pasta and saw that this was the closest one at walking distance in pioneer square. I would give this place a 0 if I could.
We were seated by an older woman who looked like might own the place given by her terrible and careless attitude. As you enter, there is no signage or check in booth, so you are left wondering how far deep you have to go into the restaurant to ask for help. We walk in a few steps and the owner gets up from a dining table similar to one that someone would keep at home - and comes up to us and ask us to be seated. The dining table was a mess, it looked like her office. There was a laptop, a couple of Starbucks cups and a stack of paperwork. We were sat right next to her table. And opposite from her - what seemed like her home office desk - was a mini bar. LOL - it was basically a buffet with a bunch of bottles of alcohol sitting there.
We sat down and were asked right away if we wanted anything to drink besides water. We asked for a drink menu and the owner said that she didn't have one ... we asked her to give us a few minutes. And when she came back we were still confused so we ended up not ordering a drink.
Our water glasses were FILTHY! We even told her that we would like a new glass, she kept telling us that "" they're not dirty, we just stack them on top of each other "" ok - the glass was literally cracked on the inside, it's like when you scrape a piece of glass against something and there is some debris coming off from it .. we then told her "" ok, can we still get a replacement glass "" she just made her way out - this was after taking our order. Her attitude was terrible that we ended up getting up and walking out of there!
What really irritated me was that she didn't care that we asked for a new glass to drink out of - or had a drink menu for us to choose from , and with her filthy attitude - they have the audacity to charge a 20% gratuity! No ma'am , I used to be a server and I got tipped for my service. And this place did not deserve a single dime.
I will not be returning. We didn't even get a chance to try the food, but the way you treat your customers is what matters most! I am surprised that they haven't gone out of business yet - it's just a waste of space in pioneer square."

The instructor was pleasant and knowledgeable and the food that we prepared (very hands on) was good but the menu was nothing like the examples online and the instructor was not the restaurants chef as advertised.
We used a groupon for the class and then had to pay additional the night of for taxes and gratuity (for the restaurant staff not the instructor). Very odd. The woman (owner? Manager?) that was checking us in was unusual, slightly rude.
I don't think we will be back to this restaurant in pioneer square and with so many choices in Seattle it's not somewhere we'd recommend."
"Luigi’s Italian Eatery","https://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-italian-eatery-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Bill T.","This one is a bit of a head scratcher. The ratings on Yelp are very high, but our actual experience was more in the 2 to 2.5 star range.
Came here on a Saturday night and it was fairly busy but had a few empty tables. Once we were acknowledged by someone, they said we'd have a table in a few minutes and we did. The guy who took our order was nice and we made it simple...two salads and three spaghetti and meatballs (Polpette). Watching the other tables, it seemed like each one had a wrong order delivered. The table right next two us asked for the check before they got their food because they'd been waiting so long and then when the food came, it was wrong (although the correct food came out quickly).
Our spaghetti and meatballs came out quickly. Unfortunately, we hadn't received any salads so we asked about those. The guy who delivered the food asked what we had ordered and he went to check. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was decent, though a bit bland. I'll be honest that I didn't care for the meatballs as they were filled with raisins and pine nuts. Just not a fan of that texture so I just ate the pasta.
A server comes back to check on us and we ask about the salads again. Then we ask if we can have some garlic bread. We did receive some garlic bread (which was not the style I like, very toasted with lots of garlic and butter...this was barely heated with just a bit of garlic) but still no salad. At that point, the server asks if we still want the salads since we are almost finished the meal and we just said we wanted one of them. We finally got that and it was okay.
The bill came quickly and we paid and left. It was just an odd place. There were two ""manager"" types (an older man and woman) who seemed to be fussing around at the ""desk"" by the front door but the servers were really hustling. Just seemed nobody was communicating with one another. As I didn't care for the style of food that was served, I would not return. Not a very welcoming or organized place, based on my experience."

I thought the wording and grammar means (present perfect) it is in the price already.
I was surprised to see that our bill came to $90 and it was an incredibly bad meal. Pizza swimming in grease, terrible lasagna and a suspiciously light tasting glass of red wine and one tiny appetizer.
I asked about why the note didn't say: ""... will be added"".
The owner was rude and said there is nothing wrong with the wording, and no one had ever mentioned it!! Well, then he never read his yelp reviews because 1 out of 3 reviews do mention it - as a surprise and as a disappointment.
1 star is a lot when (did I mention the service was rude and the water was lukewarm tap water? - which is kind of an oxymoron)
- the food is horrible
- the prices are high
- the portions are small
- the 20% tip is mandatory

I always like to give places the lasagna test because and as easy as it seems to make, I've encountered some horrible tasting lasagnas. This lasagna was hands down some of the best I've ever tasted. Everything about it was perfect. On top of everything the prices were very reasonable.
This place is definitely a gem and a must visit for authentic Italian."
"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Chris S.","The smell of garlic was in the air as we entered the large dining room and we were warmly greeted and quickly seated. The menu is extensive with several pizza options as well as several pasta, chicken, seafood and veal dishes.
Wine was very reasonably priced with glasses of house wine starting at just $5, a half liter for $12 and a liter for $20. I had a glass of their Sicilian Nero d'Avola ($6) which was dark, robust and filled to the brim ... HOOAH!
All meals come with soup or salad and fresh, warm, delicious bread and butter, ranging from $11 to $18.50. My wife had the Cheese Ravioli in Pesto Sauce ($12.50) and I the Veal Saltimbocca ($18.50). The salads were small, but fresh with lettuce, carrots, croutons and choice of dressing.
The ravioli was a bit of a disappointment with just ten on the plate, looking as if they were mass produced, not made in-house. The pesto sauce was pretty good, but my wife was still a bit hungry after finishing her small salad and ten medium size ravioli.
My veal was abundant and tasty, but not what I was expecting. Veal saltimbocca (alla Romana) normally comes with veal scallops topped with thin slices of prosciutto and topped with fresh mozzarella in a light sauce of butter, a little lemon and fresh sage, but this sauce was very spicy with a tomato base. It was good, but I was expecting something different. The spaghetti aglio e olio (garlic and olive oil) was also abundant and a good choice to accompany the saltimbocca.
My wife was born it Sicily and raised in Naples, Italy and I, beside being of Italian descent, lived in Italy for nearly three and a half years in addition to having traveled there extensively, so we have higher expectations than most when eating at Italian restaurants. Pizzuto's does a better job than many stateside Italian eateries and the prices are definitely affordable, but the food was not as authentic as it could have been. Had the salads been a little bigger, the ravioli more abundant, and the saltimbocca sauce more traditional, they would have definitely scored an extra bomb or two.

Entrees come with a small house salad don't see that often now days what a great touch. I grew up in Rainer Valley going to Vince's that's what Pizzuto's reminds me if a family owned restaurant great for family. It appeared
to be a neighborhood favorite. Wide variety of protein selections. Large portions and friendly service you'll definitely have leftovers.

"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike K.","Pizuttos is the perfect neighborhood Italian restaurant. I've been coming here nearly 20 years, since I moved to Seward Park.
Don't expect high end Italian, think red checked table cloths (though that just changed). Expect iceberg lettuce salad, minestrone, big portions, wonderful rolls and a great value in the 1/2 carafe wine.
We typically bring half our dinners home and we're not light eaters.
Always friendly staff and on a Friday night after a long week at work, Phone is a lovely way to unwind close to home and in the company of our neighborhood.
A gem and a blessing to have in this day of the next big thing dining in Seattle."
"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gregg K.","My review is a generous four stars.
Pizzuto's is like every other neighborhood Italian-American restaurant that you can find all over the country. The menu is extensive, the prices are low, and the servings are very, very large.
The restaurant was filled to capacity by 7:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, and it appeared there were a lot of locals by the greetings of the serving staff. Our server Rae was very nice, friendly, and took good care of us in the crowded setting.
One caveat is that like most Italian-American restaurants, canned olives are used on all the dishes such as the salads and pizzas.
We tasted three dishes, and they were all well-prepared and quite good.
If you're looking for authentic Italian, well, this may not be the place for you, but the food is good enough to make me want to return."

"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Anonymous Z.","Nondescript place between a law firm and a coffee shop. Food is decent, except for the meatballs. They are too spicy, especially for a kids serving off spaghetti and meatball. They either need to alter their recipe or make separate meatballs for the kid's meals. Chicken/Veal Parm are great.
The carbonara is ok, but doesn't have peas!
Pizzas are great."

Family-friendly service and delicious Italian food - with all of the classics. Our family ordered a custom pizza, carbonara, and a mixed Italian salad. Pasta tasted great with the Lucille IPA Excited to see this place continue to thrive."
"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","itslikethisanna O.","Low key but delicious Italian restaurant. I've had a few of the pastas, gnocchi and carbonara being my favorites. Haven't tried the pizza yet, but will go for that next. Always take a tiramisu home for dessert.

"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Linda K.","Horrible Italian food. Not sure why people like this place. I live only 3 blocks away and have been here twice. First time I didn't like it. And a year later, I thought, I'll give it another try. I was wrong. It still is awful. I got a chicken dish with mushrooms and artichoke. It tasted entirely like alcohol, like they didn't cook the sauce off enough. My son got the mixed spaghetti and ravioli with meatball and sausage. Marinara is sour and sausage very dry. I cook better than this at home! The only thing going for this place is that it's a neighborhood place, portions are really large, and free soup or salad. Price is reasonable but I'd be willing to pay a little more for better tasting food. This has the same stars as La Medusa, a top Italian restaurant in seattle which is strange and why I rate this restaurant a 1 star."
"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","BigCity G.","I know I am in the right place when I open the door and the welcoming aroma of roasted garlic wafts by. Food is very traditional/home-cooked comfort and the freshly baked bread is irresistible. Classics like veal parmigian with a side of bolognese spaghetti are delicious, and the heavier creamy pastas are perfect (especially if you're able to steal a few bites from your dining companion). MUST order the homemade caesar salad as your complimentary starter. The anchovies are mild and really add to the tasty, lighter dressing, but you can always request the salad with them. Service has always been warm and friendly. Friends recommend the pizza - I need to try it soon. I keep ordering an entree when I dine here. Highly recommended neighborhood gem!
To the owners: thank you for serving the community and warmest regards!"
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","I've been here several times, over the past couple years. I have never been disappointed with the food. Tonight, we started with a chopped salad, and I had the rack of lamb with a side of meatballs.
While the establishment is smaller in size, the restaurant does not feel over crowded. Our server was very friendly and efficient."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Elisabeth P.","There is another Grazie in Bothell that we absolutely love, so we were really looking forward to trying another location. We stopped in here for dinner with friends and were excited to show them some of our favorite items on the menu but found out that they have slightly different menus actually. So we tried some new things instead of going for our usual favs.
This location is quite a bit smaller than the one in Bothell but is located in a great spot in between Seatac and the Tukwila mall, great place to grab a bite if you are waiting for someone to land. The beautiful iron center divides help to break up the one dining room and make it feel more intimate and the hanging stars from the ceiling and low lighting add a nice effect.
We were able to get a table quickly but had some issues ordering gluten free for me which was surprising because it was so easy at their other location. They did not offer the same gf items and the server wasn't really sure what was and wasn't gf as far as sauces were concerned, she just knew they had gf pasta. After some questioning I was able to order the mushroom spaghetti and the husband had the cannelloni.
We shared a caprese salad with our friends, which was a bit short on the basil but the mozzarella was nice. My pasta was just so so and our friends and the husband said the cannelloni they both ordered was okay but not super memorable. They didn't have the same gf dessert items as the Bothell location so we skipped dessert.
Overall, it was a pretty good place and I'm sure there might be other menu items that were even better than what we tried. Perhaps it was just our expectations coming from the great experiences at the Bothell location, but this one just didn't quite live up its sister location in service, gf availability, and overall taste."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Amandeep S.","This is the definition of a hidden gem: located in the corner of a strip mall next to Men's Warehouse, I would have never guessed for this to be such an amazing Italian restaurant!
My husband and I are nuts over Italian food and ever since we came back from our honeymoon in Italy, we've tried finding a place that gives us that authentic Italian taste - this place is the closest we have found!
We've been here 3-4 times now, and my latest visit last week really compelled me to finally leave a review. We've always had an amazing time here, each and every visit. This last visit, my husband and I took both our mothers for dinner, and let me also say that this place is always packed! But luckily we were able to get a table for 4 with a same day reservation (probably because it was a weekday), though it was still busy.
Our server was so nice and patient with both helping make suggestions on dishes and also giving us enough time to decide. I got the Ravioli Rosé and added grilled chicken - it was DELICIOUS! Highly highly recommend. It was perfectly balanced, not too salty and made the perfect dish to pair with a glass of red wine.
For dessert, we all shared the tiramisu - also delicious. To top it all off, after we had left, my mom forgot her purse and our server actually came running out after us with it! He was a really good server, I'm sad I forgot his name. Regardless, we will be back! This is our go-to for authentic Italian food :)"
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Alma B.","Absolutely lovely take on Italian cuisine.
Creative, interesting use of flavors and sauces. Somehow, they managed to make spinach taste like a beautiful dream. And lamb, oh ...wow. So tender, I could cut it with a fork. Usually, I don't care for taste of lamb, it was truly extraordinary.
The ambiance is very romantic and cozy, servers are simply gorgeous (is that like a job requirement?),
It is on a pricey side, luckily I had my trusty Passport Unlimited, it is what brought me here in the first place.
Coming back!!"
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi N.","Grazie has continued to be one of my fav Italian restaurants! It's hidden away in a plaza area next to the mall but it's a gem. It's a very small and cozy restaurant with little seating but it's worth the wait. We ordered calamari and this cheese marinara dip thing (can't remember the name) but oh it's so good. Cheese and bread can't get better than that! They also give complimentary bread with olive oil. Something about their seasoned olive oil is sooo good. I opted for the pear Gorgonzola ravioli with chicken and it doesn't skimp on flavors! Flavors here ARE NOT LACKING so expect pungent and rich flavors! I love love Gorgonzola so it was an amazing dish for me. I'd have to say too much chicken compared to the amount of ravioli which isn't a bad thing! My family's dishes were also really great and extra flavorful.
Dishes are on the more pricey side but imo it's worth the higher price point. Service is great and desserts are beautiful."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Carla J.","I came in to Grazie with high expectations after hearing that their chefs train in Italy and good things from people I know. Because of this I suggested we try Grazie for dinner on Sunday night with out of town guests. Not all my expectations were met but overall a decent meal but with a little bit of a higher price tag than it deserved.
Service here was great. Everyone was super attentive, our water was refilled multiple times all without a prompt. Our appetizers and meals were quickly on our table so there's no issue with how they treat their guests.
The decor at Grazie felt a little off. For a place like this, I expected something a little more modern to go along with how they price their dishes but instead it felt like a chain Italian restaurant nearby. I also noticed a distinctly fishy smell in the air and I couldn't place where it was coming from, this above all was off-putting to me.
For appetizers we ordered caesar salad. The salads were well dressed and seasoned nicely but their dressing was super packed with garlic, to the point that our palettes were almost blown for the rest of the meal... and we love garlic. As for our entrees, nothing particularly remarkable about them. I had Pollo Al Limone, which was pretty much chicken piccata with artichokes. The odd thing about this dish is they serve it with their ""house pasta"" which is pasta with a tomato sauce. I've had a lot of chicken piccata (and dishes like it) and I have never seen someone pair that protein and sauce with something tomato based. It just seemed wrong to me. I wish they included more of a description of their house pasta on their menu because I would have asked for a substitution... or just plain pasta!
At the end of our meal, we got our checks and paid our bills. The server accidentally charged the wrong cards for the wrong bill. One of the amounts charge didn't even match a bill so we were not sure where that came from. We understood mistakes happen so we had no problem with him fixing the issue but he had to hunt down his manager to resolve the problem. I was uncomfortable with our credit cards being out for possession for as long as they were. The manager should have come to us and apologized but we never saw them.
Unless there's a happy hour special, I don't think I will be back. There was nothing remarkable that I tasted that I would crave to go back for. Their pricing is definitely higher than I think it should be, portion size is average. For example, $27 for their Pollo Limone is just too much."

I've passed this place a billion times and can't believe it's taken me this long to try it out. The menu has a lot of variety and the prices are very reasonable. I ended up getting pasta carbonara and it was some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. On top of everything they give you this pesto and olive oil that you put on the bread they serve. Out of this world good.
At the end of your meal, they show you the dessert display and every last item looked delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have taken a slice of Tiramisu. In addition to everything, the customer service was excellent.
Will definitely be back soon to try more items."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Melissa C.","Everything was just average -- that includes service, decor, pasta, and bread. I had high expectations coming in to a place with more than 4 stars, but there really isn't anything memorable. Even the seafood was just mediocre and possibly frozen, and that was surprising since I'm visiting this town with lots of fresh seafood options. In fact, we even had no desire to finish the slightly overly peppered lump of starch (angel hair pasta) at the end. There's nothing wrong with this place though if all you want is a simple dish of pasta"
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Thao H.","Feels just like a home cook meal. The food flavor is definitely different from an Olive Garden. They have a good variety of options on their menu and they kept it to a one page menu, which is great. The service was good. Our server actually checked up on us. I would of gave them five stars, but the bread they gave us was very hard and they sticked use at an extremely small table that kept on rocking back and forth located close to the restroom.
Overall, it was an ok experience. It's a good Italian food alternative to the Olive Garden and this place has more of an intimate vibe to it."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Creighton R.","Glad I found this spot for dinner on Yelp while on a business trip in Tacoma. Not much around where I was staying. Since I was alone, I ate at the bar. The host escorted me over to the bar and the waitress showed up almost immediately. I asked for some
recommendations on food, which she was happy to oblige and suggested a few key items. Started off with a hunk of bread with olive oil and a red Zin that was just how I like it. Ordered the waitress' suggestions -- spinaci and the Linguini Del Mare. Spectacular choices! Wish I had not eaten the whole hunk of bread but when in Rome! Enjoy!"
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Marjorie H.","I wanted to like this place, I really did. But our experience went downhill once the server brought us our water.
First, the Chianti was mediocre at best. It had very little flavor, and the longer it sat and warmed, the harder I found it was to drink. It began to have an aftertaste that was unpleasant.
Next came the bread. Most Italian places we have been to serve warm, fresh bread. This was neither warm nor fresh. It wasn't even cut the whole way through, and we were not given a knife to finish the cuts. The bread was tough, and dry. The oil dipping mix was good, but it was lacking fresh ground pepper.
Our food was mediocre at best. I got Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the meatballs were uneatable, my husband got the Piatti (seafood and ravioli) - his seafood was over cooked and rubbery and his ravioli was under cooked. Plus the shrimp in his dish still had the tails on. Since the dish had pasta, the tails really should have had the removed. It makes for a very messy situation otherwise. The third member of our party got the Fettuccine Alfredo Chicken. The chicken came out mostly fatty pieces, and the fettuccine sauce had no flavor. Worst of all was the kids chicken meals. Pre-frozen Dinosaurs Chicken nuggets. Now, I understand how this might seem easier for the restaurant. But kids deserve to have food that comes without any additives. Every other Italian restaurant that we visit frequently offers freshly breaded chicken tenders.
Needless to say, when the server finally came back to offer dessert, we all passed and drove over to Panera Bread instead. We never got drinks refilled, and had to share our water with the kids in order to refill their drinks."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Scott L.","Chicken Alfredo was marginal. Sauce wasn't thick enough; flavor was not great. Puttanesca was good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was fine. Prices were too expensive for the quality of the food. Overall, I'd give it a 5/10. Not headed back soon."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Sally M.","Looking for a place that had gluten-free offerings and really tasty food, my coworker found Grazie on Yelp...4.5 stars, let's try it!
We showed up around 6PM and it was very busy, but we were fortunately able to get a table after waiting for 5 minutes. It's not too big of a restaurant, but they were very accommodating to all party sizes and moved tables around frequently to seat people.
I have to say, the food was delicious! I started with the spinaci salad, which was a decent portion size for just $6. The salad was pretty filling with the egg, pine nuts, and pancetta. For my entree, I ordered the large size of the tortellini gorgonzola and added chicken. Wow, this dish was so good! I only ate half and the leftovers tasted just as good the next day. I can see how this dish is so popular. The gorgonzola was just the right amount and I wasn't sure if the chicken I added would work well, but it was really tasty and gave me the extra protein I wanted.
Service was good as well. Even though it was so busy, our server took the time to answer our questions and provide recommendations.
It's located in a small strip mall near mattress stores with plenty of parking. You would never expect to find such great Italian food in this spot, but it is delicious. I'd definitely recommend checking out Grazie if you're in the area."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","JJ G.","Bad STAY AWAY... over charged my credit card.
Came in twice this week and this is upscale casual where are you going to spend about $40-$60 per person. So they come and take my wine and meal order. Kid you not, 5 minutes later the glass of wine and my dinner is delivered. So I say my goodness. I want to enjoy the wine before dinner. The reply was well yes we've been in business for 31 years and our cooks are fast. Reason to logic, with sit down dinner service, they should not focus on pushing food out fast just to flip tables quicker. I get it--it's a small place but taking that few extra minutes to let the guests enjoy shows they care. They don't care at this place. My reply was, well this is upscale casual.... I ordered a Chianti which I like to consume prior to digesting my Meal in this relaxed atmosphere. So she said well...we can just remove your wine. Not even apologetic. They care not, Since they got a regular flow of guests coming in and making money and are be busy; these situations and bad service and concerns matter not. They said should we just take your glass of wine away we're busy enough attitude. So the wow factor is out the window here. Both my visits were the same. The first time I sat at the bar and the food came within like 10 minutes with the server saying like you need to order this... the most expensive item. Only because I waited to overlook the menu being there the first time I was probably asked for five times if I was ready to order it but I stayed drinking my glass of wine before I ordered. I should've done that the second visit. This is not fast food service. It's upscale casual people need to relax and unwind between courses. What got me, was the attitude we've been business for 31 years. Like that justifies miss treating people or dismissing their concerns."

My friend got the cannelloni and started chewing on a piece of plastic or tape after taking a bite. Bread and garlic/oil served before dinner was good (would've been great if bread was served warm rather than cold). Other friends had a seafood pasta and chicken pasta that they both liked.

Obviously it's a nice restaurant, so that's expected. The only reason I'm even writing this review is because when we ordered, the waitress asked if we wanted a salad WITH our food. She asked as if it was a side salad and considering that we were paying $20 for a small plate of mediocre pasta I assumed it would be included. Come to pay the bill and we were charged an extra $15 JUST FOR SALAD! Salad prices were no where on the menu either. We racked up a $70 bill for 2 small plates of pasta and 2 salads.

Dad and I were looking for some place open on new year's day for lunch and we found Mioposto open. Being a holiday and probably one of the few places open they were swamped. But their crew remained professional, friendly and with a smile through it all. Ee could tell the kitchen was a little backed up but they were working their as hard as they could, non stop cranking quality food out. Great customer service and the egg in my shakshuka was cooked perfectly I've been other places that over cooked it so much it was hard boiled. Thanks for starting our year off perfectly!
11/23/18 Came her post holiday half off sock shopping with my dad and sister. Was about 10:30 found parking right across the street. Placed our order at the counter and our food and coffee were delivered. Been a few times since my first review. Tried something new. My sis had the PANENATA
Mio Baked Bread soaked in egg custard oven roasted in a skillet with apples & pancetta, finished with cinnamon and powdered sugar. Served with organic maple syrup. A great salty sweet combo. Dad and I had the hash I love that it cones with arugula adds nice freshness to the hash. Service is always friendly great neighborhood go to"

The regular prices aren't terrible either, but if your curious, I'd opt for the happy hour just to try it out first. I usually order the antipasti because of the large portions and delicious taste. I'm not much of a pizza person, but I will say that their crust is amazing! Everything is stone fired so it has a wonderful texture with just a hint of smokey-ness. Yum! One thing to note though is that this place is no secret. It's loved by many so if you don't go early, or make a reservation, you will be waiting. Enjoy!"

Mioposto is one of the better reviewed pizza offerings through Caviar, and I'm always game for a Margherita pizza. The pizza that I received was just okay, but didn't make me feel the $14.95 price matched the quality or the size.
The pizza was more dough than pizza (even distribution of sauce, cheese, and dough). For being wood fired, the pizza felt pretty soggy (I put it in the oven for a 2nd cooking just in case, after trying one slice).
If I give Mioposto another go, whether via delivery or in person, I'll update the review but for now shelling out almost $15 for a trial run doesn't seem worth the hassle."

This pizza shop was a great place for me to meet a friend. I ordered their lunch special: a Prosciutto e Arugula personal pizza and a side Cesar salad. The pizza was some of the best I had - crispy, Italian style with obviously fresh ingredients. Their Cesar salad was nicely balanced and a great complement. The number one thing I loved was the service. Our waitress was extremely attentive but gave my friend and I enough space to chat. We must've talked at our table for a couple of hours but our waitress was immediate on getting our checks and not bothersome when we delved into our conversation.

We went on the weekend (late Saturday afternoon) and opted for their small salad and pizza combo (note: it's only available until 3pm), which was a steal (I believe it was $14/person, but I could be a few dollars off). I got the beet salad and margarita pizza (extra crispy) and my husband got the caesar salad and pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side. We both LOVED everything! The beet salad was perfectly tossed in dressing and I loved the crumbled almonds. The pizzas were a smaller size on the combo special, so that made us feel a little healthier :) They were perfectly crispy with a perfect balance of flavors.
We also tried a few Washington wines. My husband got their cab and I got the red blend. Both of us were impressed! The red blend was very full-bodied and so smooth.
The service was great as well! Everythign was timed well with apps coming out and then the pizzas shortly afterwards.
If you are looking for a great go-to pizza spot, I highly recommend giving this spot a try!"

Service was so warm and welcoming, drinks were delightful and the pizza! It was delicious even for one of the more safe/basic options they had. Would love to come back here, it's right across the street from a park too so we had a nice view for lunch."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Tom E.","Delicious, interesting unusual flavors like lamb pizza and clam-proscuttio. Fresh handmade dough, nicely toasted crust, and some of the delicate ingredients added late in the cooking process so they weren't overcooked. Really friendly knowledgeable and warm service, and a beautiful summery setting next to a park."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Tami G.","I am housesitting down the street and my roomate and I popped in for breakfast this morning. I ordered the breakfast hash, and he the Shakshouka (spelling?) with a side of hashbrowns. Food was decent. The location and atmosphere and service were great, food was just ok. I would be curious how the pizza tastes, and would be willing to try that but with a gluten allergy, italian places dont usually cater well to me. I was impressed that they brought hot sauce with breakfast, and no ketchup in sight, in fact, they dont even have it! Cute spot though. Glad we stopped by. Ill update if I ever get to try that pizza, but if you have a gluten allergy they do list the allergens on the menu which is nice."

"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Abby K.","This is a great spot in Mt. Baker. We ordered the lamb sausage pizza, clams with bread and a glass of Chardonnay and a local cider. Everything was phenomenal and the service was lovely too. Unfortunately we were too full to try dessert but they had options that sounded delicious like a rum-spiked tiramisu and amaretto hazelnut ice cream. Next time! We also weathered a major thunderstorm and briefly lost power during dinner. No interruptions in service."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Rachel P.","No trip to Seattle is complete without my Mioposto! I usually stay nearby the Mt. Baker joint, or within commuting distance. My first time here, I dined in because it was summer, and I was staying nearby in an Airbnb - they recommended this place!
I don't eat meat, but that doesn't matter. You need to try the Quattro Formaggi pizza! The lemon zest makes it!!!
In fact, I have recommended this pizza by word of mouth than any other restaurant I've ever been to!!!
Last trip I ordered via a delivery service as it was further away, raining, cold, and I had had a cocktail or two! I am happy to know I can get my order in! I ordered 2 pizzas: my usual & the crowd favourite Con le Petate.
My take on the Patate: wayyyy too much oil. Like the pizza crust was soaked in oil and the box even was leaking oil all over. I think the chef used the whole bottle of truffle oil on it. It was 15,000 calories a slice after that. The taste was good, but you just can't get the oils off of your hands or palate for hours. Worst of all: I made a huge mess at my host's place by placing the box on the counter while I ate (yes, I cleaned it up but took ages). Would I order it again? Absolutely no!!!
Stick with the Quattro Formaggi...sincerely the best pizza I have ever had!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Candace H.","Mioposto is located on the corner of a cute neighborhood in south seattle. We came here on a Sunday around 11:45a as a party of 2 and did not have to wait for seating. The restaurant was about 1/2 full when we got there.
They have tables throughout their restaurant but also 4 spots of high top window seating at the front. We got seated by the windows which was perfect on a spring seattle morning! You get to people watch as you eat too because there's a cute park right across the street.
They have a brunch menu available so of course we went for those options. The waiter was really kind to walk us through the menu and I thought it was cool that everything was cooked in their fire oven. We ended up getting...
-THE BAKER - kind of reminded me of a shakshuka and i'm not entirely sure why it wasn't called a shakshuka because it tasted like and texturally was so similar to one! This dish was delicious and it comes with their house made bread. Their eggs were perfectly poached and the yolks were runny.
-MORNING HASH - what is brunch without hash browns? Their hashbrowns are cooked in a skillet in their fire oven to get that extra crispyness. You can get the eggs how you want, we chose sunny side up, one of the eggs was sunny and runny but the other was kind of cooked which was a little disappointing. Pancetta was crispy and flavorful and the arugula pairs well with the dish for a refreshing little kick of flavor and texture.
Our waiter also served our food and came with mini bottles of cholula and tapatio hot sauce; this i really appreciated and im sure all condiments/cholula/tapatio-on-brekkie-food friends can relate ;)
Overall a great experience and they actually do bottomless mimosas for brunch (i noticed this a little too late!) which I have to come back for next time! Their breakfast stramboli (like a breakfast calzone) sounded and looked awesome (yes i also spy on what my neighboring strangers order...) and I would love to try that next time."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","June C.","Ok, great spot for a family dinner or date! Super loved the small space and intimate atmosphere. We arrived 5 pm on a Sunday and full but still places to sit. Never a wait for a table the whole time we were here. Started with happy hr specials that go to 6 pm every day. Great salads and drinks and small plates and pizza. We shared a delicious beet salad and wonderful zucca balsamic pizza! So yummy! Very great wait staff and especially Christie! She was fantastic!!! We will come again many times."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Stacy S.","I am giving 4 stars due to the service. My friends took me here for my 18th birthday and when we arrived, we were told it was a 25 minute wait, but we waited almost an hour. We wouldn't have minded an hour wait, but the upsetting part is being told a false wait time. It also seemed like staff was taking their time.
The actual server we had was really nice even though she had lost her voice. I liked her service a lot, she wished me a happy birthday like 3 times, made me feel kinda special.
Now for the food.
We got the potato pizza and the classic pizza (forgot the names). The pizza with the thinly sliced potatoes was amazing! I have never had a pizza with potatoes on it, it was so unique and delicious. The other pizza was just a cheese pizza, but not much cheese. It was still yummy though.
To top off the night, we had ordered their chocolate mousse cake and it was fucking bomb as hell. I was going to eat the whole thing by myself, but I had to let my friends try a little bit to experience the taste (plus they brought 3 forks LOL). I loved the cake and I'll probably come back just for the cake alone.
I believe this place doesn't take reservations unless it's a large group, so just be prepared for some waiting. There's really nowhere to wait except in the crowded entry way. For the business, I would recommend setting up a text messaging system to alert people when their table is going to be ready."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Mike S.","I have driven by this corner for 20+ years and never stopped in until yesterday. I went to Mioposto not knowing what they served for food or anything at all just based on the location and the look from outside. The restaurant has a new and warm/inviting feel to it. It just seemed like a good place to be. They have very large open windows for air to flow through on the hot summer nights. People were sitting inside and outside the restaurant.
We just walked in at 8pm with 4 people,no wait. The server was very friendly and fast, our drinks came in a couple minutes.
The prices were reasonable for Seattle. I ordered a meatball sandwich, others had a pizza, lasagna, and a beat salad with chicken.
We were all happy with the experience and I would recommend to anyone to check the place out."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael G.","3.5 stars would be most accurate, but this place deserves the benefit of the doubt for 4 stars. The food is very good, and they use very fresh high quality ingredients. Pizzas are awesome and the salads are well constructed for superior flavor. An exception is their meatballs that left a lot to be desired. They were very small, dried out, and lacking in flavor. I also would prefer they use veal and/or beef, and not the added pork in the meatballs, as not everyone can eat that. Another challenge is that although the food is generally very good, their menu is extremely limited with not so many options. I wish they would add more fish and clams, or Italian style tenderized chicken/veal dishes.
It is definitely expensive. I recall some of the pasta dishes were around $24 a plate, yet they were also extremely delicious. I also really appreciate that they offer complimentary bread and olive oil, as well as delicious olives served at the bar. That makes the higher prices more worth it.
The atmosphere is excellent, and the service was pretty strong making the high prices more worth it. My only complaint on service is they served pizzas excatly at the same time with pasta dishes instead of phasing them, and it was too challenging to eat everything before items started getting cold. That was a big service miss.
When they have live music they definitely elevate to at least 4 stars!"
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan L.","The vibe of this place is SO cute! My boyfriend and I wanted Italian food last night so we decided to try this place out. We made a reservation but weren't actually seated for around 10-15 mins, which was a little irritating but that's alright.
Once we sat; however, the service was fast. We got our food really quickly and someone was there to take our order almost immediately when we sat down. I got the small lasagna (I wasn't that hungry) and it was really yummy! I wished I had gotten the bigger one because it was delicious. My boyfriend got the gnocchi and I also loved that. I don't even usually like gnocchi, but the sauce that it was served it was just great. Both were pretty pricey however, and while the food quality was good, I still think it was a bit pricey.
Our server was really nice and got our order in pretty quickly, but other than that we didn't see her much. She was really busy though, and being a server myself I understand, and wasn't very bothered by that.
Overall, this place is really good and you probably won't be disappointed if you try it out. For me, it just didn't blow me out of the water with food or service like some places I've tried, so I feel 4 stars is a fair rating."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kyra D.","Genuinely one of the best plates of pasta I've ever had. They made me fettuccine with vodka sauce and it was perfect. My friend got a pizza and she also thought it was great. The vibe is cozy, the neighborhood is so pretty and cute. We sat right at the window and we loved our time here. The service was quick and the staff were very nice. I will be dreaming about my pasta forever."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Merlyn R.","This was our first meal in Seattle, and I can't say there was any disappointment. There was a fancier atmosphere (we were a bit underdressed) with a nice interior, white table clothes, and excellent service. The food was fresh and delicious. They catered very nicely to a dairy allergy as you can see in the picture (half cheese / half no cheese). This was a little more expensive than expected, however, you're paying for the experience as well as freshly made Italian food! One pizza can feed two making it more affordable."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tammy Y.","Delicious authentic Italian food, made with simple ingredients that leave a hearty impression! Valentine's day dinner here was such a delight. I have driven past here countless times and have even walked all the way home from this area before. For some reason I didn't realize there was a gem sitting in plain sight the whole time! Not sure where the less than 5-star ratings are coming from because this restaurant is absolutely lovely.
For a completely full house for 3.5 hours straight the service was good and I didn't feel rushed at any point during the meal. When I saw the queue of 10+ people waiting at the door I realized why it seemed that the servers were rushing around - and did the responsible thing (quickly cleared out!)
The table bread was very fresh - best table bread in the city! And we loved the pomodoro appetizer. Goat cheese and tomatoes juxtaposed by crunchy toasted crostini was pure perfection. The gnocchi melted in my mouth and was so satisfying that I only needed to eat half of the entree - the other half I finished for lunch the next day! The vegetarian lasagna was simple, delicate, and wholesome. Words cannot describe the best lasagna I have ever had IN MY LIFE.
My only complaint was that the aisles in the restaurant were a little cramped in certain areas and on a busy night this was a bit chaotic. Not a deterrent for me however - I can't wait to return!"
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Greg M.","I have not been here for a year or so. Six of us had dinner on a Sunday night. We were seating at 6:30 and things got really busy as the place filled up. Service was pretty poor- had to ask for bread to be brought to the table, took a long time to take our orders, and we waited at least 1/2 hour before our main dishes arrived. Service is usually really good here, so I'm assuming they were either understaffed or there were issues with the kitchen being backed up. Whatever reason, very disappointing for a place that has been around this long and should be firing on all cylinders.
As always, the lasagna is the best you can find anywhere. They have nailed this recipe for years, and it is always perfect. Very labor intensive to make it this well, and it shows. 5 stars.
Tried the gnocchi in vodka tomato cream sauce. Really excellent. An upper end Italian restaurant should not have gnocchi on the menu unless they know it will be perfect. This was as good as the best gnocchi I've had in Rome. Super light, great texture, flavorful sauce. As good as it gets.
Smoked beet salad, while not traditional, was excellent. Just the right amount of smoke flavor, well balanced vinaigrette that hit against the smokiness just perfectly.
Contorni of wood oven roasted carrots was the only real miss. Not cooked nearly long enough, they were served with a steak knife for cutting. The texture was not that far from raw carrots, and they needed at least 5 or 10 more minutes in the oven to help with the texture. Pretty flavorless and very disappointing.
To be honest, I was taken out for this meal and for that reason really enjoyed it, but if I had been picking up the tab I would have felt differently. Great Italian food in restaurants is understandably expensive- it is all about top quality ingredients and a kitchen that can execute without overdoing it. For the most part, Cafe Lago is still pulling this off, but this was not a slam dunk. If I go back I'll be sure to get the lasagna, which never disappoints."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Melissa R.","Here's what to expect when dining here:
For the price you pay, you get your money's worth without feeling over stuffed. Serving size is just the right amount of food, even if you order an appetizer plus a main course. Seasoning is on point and the sauces are flavorful. Simple yet delicious at the same time.
The service is prompt and the flow of delivery (beverages and food) is surprisingly steady. Remember to smile and thank your host(ess) and servers.
Recommendations: Use Open Table or call ahead to make reservations. Missed out on eating here a couple times because tables were booked up."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","The last time I ate at Cafe Lago , definitely it was during the pre Yelp days and Alex (aka The Homie) was still toddler/preschooler aged, the Crayola crayon set.
I was dealing with a very aggressive tail gater on I-5 S, so I ended up taking the 520 exit towards Montlake. So it became an obvious choice to get acquainted with Cafe Lago's legendary lasagna.
We lucked out being seated immediately as a two top in the far corner. Menus, water, and delicious bread with evoo was brought to the table shortly thereafter.
Despite getting views of fresh pizza dough being tossed and thrown in the air, The Homie selected the fresh, handmade Fettucine with Meatballs ($24).
Like him, no starter apps or salads for me. Dive right in to main pasta entrees.
I ordered the large legendary Lasagne ($22) , because I still have fond memories of those thin sheets layered with bechamel and ricotta.
Both dishes have copious and flavorful house marinara. The kind that a second batch of bread is meant to sop up it all up.
I lamented the careless dribble on my sweater. That's what fabric stain remover is for! I ate half of this lasagne to save room for dessert. I'm going to have an amazing lunch tomorrow!
Hurray for desserts! The Homie selected the Lemon Tart ($8)...paraphrasing his description of having a limoncello atop a shortbread cookie crust. Luscious lemon custard!
The biscotti (and Vin Santo) sounded great, but my inner chocophile ordered the Chocolate Truffle Cake ($8) topped with a espresso creme anglaise. Reminded me of chocolate decadence from my pastry/restaurant industry days. Mmmm without it being over the top. Goldilocks just right!
Definitely, I'd lose the powdered sugar showering of each dessert though. Thankfully no token mint leaf in sight either!
Patting my 'food baby' belly as we walked back to the car....Alex asks, ""Mom, can we visit Cafe Lago again?"" Of course, was my reply.
Next time, with a much shorter interval. So glad that Cafe Lago has been going strong since 1990!"

The pasta tastes fresh but not gummy. Service is amazing even when they are full, have never disliked any waiter there. Steak is very delicious but i think they may have a new chef who is still learning because the last time it tasted different and took a while but our server was extremely helpful and gave us free drinks due to the wait! My favourite place in seattle."

I used to go to the Montlake Alehouse next door, but that is no longer around. There was four of us on a Saturday night in March. The service was fast and the drinks and food came out quick. Nothing too complicated. The salads were basic, but people definitely ate them up. Pizzas are a huge part of the menu, so I ordered a sausage pizza.
I asked if they composted and the waitress said they did.
Good draft beer.
A warm, friendly environment."
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stephanie T.","Homey spot for quality Italian food. The bread was a great combination of fluffy and chewy. Split the artichoke salad and the fettuccine with meatballs, which was a good amount of food for 2. Artichoke salad had lots of crunchy snap peas and texture but not a lot of flavor. Went for the meatballs because we saw praise for them online- they were tasty, not life-changing. We were pleasantly surprised by the quick and attentive service- they even brought out both the salad and the pasta split in two separate plates for us. 5 stars for service, 3 stars for food."

Appetizers (tapenade with Eggplant, tomatoes, and something else) and rabbit liver pate which my parents liked were good. Handmade white pizza with Chantrelles was good. Main entrees with venison (good) but overly cheesy lasanga (where's the beef?) and clams on a bed of spaghetti were adequate.
They earned back points for dessert.

We also shared a chocolate mousse for dessert. It was pretty good, but a bit too heavy for my wife. I, the chocolate fiend, was very happy with it."

It is one of the restaurants in the Hyatt Regency and is reasonably priced for the quality of food. I tried the Trofie pasta and the grilled salmon. I was a big fan of the pasta which was made with a pesto sauce based with pistachio. I would recommend this for the pesto lovers out there. Unfortunately the salmon was not impressive. It was a bit over cooked and didn't taste very fresh. The bread service ($3) comes with a decently sized warm load and olive oil/vinegar.
Andare is the more casual one restaurant if the hotel on the first/lobby floor. This being said it does have a nice ambiance and is more casual nice than casual, but most people are dressed very casually."

Panna cotta for dessert. A bit disappointed as I can tasted it was not made fresh at the daily basis. I ate half.

I've visited several times for a quick dinner, bite to eat at the bar and for take out. The selection since the opening December '18 has remained the same and is limited albeit quite varied flavor wise - i.e., it doesn't appear they gave specials or a rotating menu. The food quality is very decent overall except for the pasta dishes where it appears that the management cuts corners with the ingredients.
Options cover a nice range from pizza to sandwiches. Taste tends towards spicy. The service in the main restaurant area is a bit different - place an order at the entrance through a tablet (someone is there to type it in for you), then wait for your food and drinks to arrive at a table of your choice. A 20% service charge is apparently no longer automatically included.
Noise level is average to loud depending on how many enthusiastic conference attendees are dining with you. Music tends to be 80s pop, not such a great choice for dining."
"Andare Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/andare-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Tiffany Z.","I had the opportunity to attend a food tasting here and wow, I'm so glad I got to try more than I thought I would.
We started off with some cocktails. I forget the name (blood orange pellegrino?) but it was def strong considering we're here during lunch. It had a grapefruit or an orange which added a nice citrus taste. They serve with ice and a side of tonic water which when you add it to the drink, it turns the color to purple! It's original color is blue from butterfly pea.
For the appetizer, we started off with Caesar salad and their signature Andare salad. Both were light full of flavor! I especially love the lemon vinaigrette on the Andare salad! We also got to try the Andare signature meatballs and wowwww that was really good! The meatballs were so tender and the grilled pizza bread was so soft and chewy! Fantastic dish and a must try!
We then were served their signature cavatelli and fettuccine carbonara! Both were amazing and I loved the whip ricotta on top of the cavatelli! It added a nice creaminess to the overall taste! The carbonara was slightly too salty for me but man I couldn't stop myself from eating more of it! Love the addition of the egg yolk which added a velvety consistency to each bite!
Then moving onto more carbs-4 different types of Pizza!!! We tried their duck, prosciutto, mushroom, and margherita! All of them were fantastic but my fav was the prosciutto and mushroom! They were so full of flavor and the prosciutto pizza had a soft egg on it!! The duck was a close second while margherita is last just because I had it before! Their pizza is thin crust, making it easier to consume after all the carbs from the pasta lol
Lastly dessert! We tried their cannolis and gelatos. The cannolis has a strong cinnamon taste to; kind of reminds me of a Mexican chocolate cookie. The cherry jam added a nice sourness which helped with the sweetness!
We tried three diff flavors of gelato: pistachio, hazelnut, and berry. My personal fav was the hazelnut! It was so nutty and rich! The pistachio didn't have a strong enough pistachio flavor but it was still good! The berry was more like a sorbet kind of flavor but had a gelato creaminess consistency. It's served with fresh berries and a slice of lemon bar or some kind of bar.
Overall I had a fantastic experience here and I would really like to thank our host Tim who did an excellent job hosting and informing us about the restaurant and food!
Interesting fact: Andare means ""On the go"" in Italian! The restaurants concept is to be like a fast casual restaurant!"
"Andare Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/andare-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Huong L.","This place was an option for lunch on my lunch app so I decided to check it out and was pleasant surprise. This is located in the new Hyatt hotel and is consider more of a sit down fancy lunch rather than a quick to go lunch. However, this place exceeded my expectations for a quick lunch.
I ordered the chicken salad and when I arrived, it was ready in a nice paper bag. The lady saw me arrive and had it ready for me to grab. When I open the box, I was pleasantly surprise as well. The chicken was a generous portion and was juicy and tender. The salad was filled with artichoke, pistachio and cheese. All the ingredients was fresh and high quality. For the price, this is a really good deal.
Would definitely come back to try other things for lunch. This place is new so they are trying to promote their restaurant and they are doing a pretty good job at it. They also have happy hour as well."
"Andare Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/andare-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Mandee O.","Finally got the chance to try Andare after a failed office lunch attempt where the building's fire alarms booted us. In natural fashion, we went back as an office for Happy Hour, because we were all still dying to try.
The ambiance is light, bright, open, chic and casual. The bar was full so we sat in the main dining area, where we were still able to order off of the Happy Hour Menu. Drinks for the table ordered: Manhattan, Aperol Spritz (only because NYT recently dissed them and we've never tried), Castleventrano Martini, and a great Red Wine pick from the bar manager. One of my coworkers knows what she wants in terms of taste of her wine, and they did a spot on job picking one out. All of the drinks were delicious and came out fast.
For food we ordered the Charcuterie Platter, Signature Meatballs & the Tuscan Bean and Kale Soup. Let me start with the Charcuterie platter, they say it is for 2, it's not, there were 4 of us and we barely finished it. It had a beautiful assortment of cheeses, meats, olives, veggies, etc. Everything was delicious. The meatballs (full order has 8 good sized balls), they were so flippin good. They do have a bit of spice to them, but I loved that part. Juicy, tender and an amazing sauce to dip the flatbread. The soup was delicious as well, jam packed with beans, kale and sausage goodness.
All in all, we all left satisfied. Service was amazing as was the rest. Will definitely be back to try some more dishes."

The bar area has a limited menu, but I just wanted a pizza, so that was fine. The bartender was very friendly and nice. After waiting a long time there (35 minutes?), the bartender checks on the food, and they forgot to make it. The food then came out quickly. On the plus side, I got the food for free. However, it took a long time. It was a margherita pizza which was, meh. So overall, my experience was not great."

Then for dessert we ordered the pistachio gelato and cannoli, both were great!
It's a beautifully designed restaurant inside of the Hyatt Regency. You order and pay before you sit down which makes it a great place to go for lunch if you work near by.

The service was not very welcoming at all. I stood there and waited for the person to look up and greet me before I could get a table. I was put off on the side. The waitress asked if I wanted anything other than water, but I wasn't given a drink menu. She seemed inconvenienced to go get one, but she did. I asked her if there was a smaller version of the salad to eat as a starter. She said I could get a side salad, so that's what I ordered. When it came to my table she stopped and ask if it was a good size in a patronizing fashion. The salad was served in too small of a bowl and difficult to eat. It didn't have much flavor and the lettuce was very watery. Before I got half way through the salad my pasta carbonara arrived. The person just laughed when she saw I still had half a salad and then walked away. The carbonara looked delicious but fell short on taste. It mainly tasted of garlic. It really needed some cheese which is important for a carbonara. I don't think I'll be coming back here."

"Carmine’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carmines-bellevue-2?osq=Italian+Food","Katy C.","After visiting Carmines in Downtown Bellevue again for my birthday I can say that it is truly one of the best dining experiences in the Seattle area.
The service is always friendly and welcoming, professional but not pretentious. They always greet with a smile and take your coats to hold while you dine. The servers think of every detail, are very knowledgeable, and truly want you to enjoy your experience.
Their food is incredible. I always get the fennel sausage pasta with a vodka cream sauce, I have a hard time ordering anything else! I started with the charred romaine salad which is also very tasty. The crispy pancetta on top is a nice touch.
My husband tried the crab risotto special and I don't think I've ever seen him enjoy and savor any other food ever!
They even gift you a biscotti when you leave to continue enjoying your meal the next day with your morning coffee
If you're looking for a spot for your next celebration, date night, or if you just want to feel a little fancy, Carmine's is the spot!"
"Carmine’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carmines-bellevue-2?osq=Italian+Food","Helene L.","Food- very good Italian food. Portions are modest to fair, will fill you to content unless you order an additional salad , side or dessert. The bread is amazing crusty outside soft inside ciabatta from Central Market Seattle (per bus boy). I got the cioppino northwest, which was piping out with yummy seafood tomato broth. The gulf shrimp were huge and white fish buttery. Husband got the white clams linguini, which was delicious, wish it had more pasta, but we asked for 2nds on bread to sop up the yummy sauce. Rigatoni Bolognese is classic and nothing to rave or complain about, I would order it again as comfort food. The insalata di mista was seriously just greens, no tomatoes, cucumbers or additions. They will substitute the dressing to a lemon vinaigrette which was solid.
Service- very good!! Attentive servers who I feel like are real Italian. Server kindly split out salad order and kids order to 2 plates.
Ambiance- I categorize as upscale rustic Italian, with the chandeliers, white table cloth, exposed beam ceilings. Beautiful entry way flowers and landscaping decorations. They have nice velvet booths and large chairs. Great for a date, celebration to celebrate, not ideal for rambunctious kids. Goes well with the Italian theme, and the restaurant name itself.
Location- across from downtown park. Street parking.
Value- fair, you pay for the whole package, of service and ambiance.
Recommend- yes."

I know they're an italian restaurant and you may feel the need to get their pasta... but i'm telling you this place should become a fancy steakhouse because their steak is damn good. I had 3 of the pasta dishes this night and all of them combined did not live up to expectations and flavour. But I highly highly recommend the steak. I think you get the point.
Also, one of THE best dining experiences here in terms of fancy restaurants regarding service and atmosphere ! So that's a plus plus plus!"

The atmosphere is incredible and the service is always wonderful. Prices can be high, but if you go with a vegetarian option and get drinks elsewhere, it can definitely be an affordable date. I always get the fettuccini al pesto without prawns. Although parking can be tricky, and it does tend to get crowded in the evenings, the food is definitely worth it.

Squid ink seafood was awesome with a little bite of heat. All and all a great place for food and very classy.
We were even presented with free birthday dessert to finish off our meal.

This place gets packed so highly recommend making reservation.
At a friend's recommendation, we went here for my birthday. Love the small details they do -- a handwritten happy birthday note card on our table and the staff's ""happy birthday"" greetings as they walk past our table.
For starters we had:
Calamari Fritti Fried squid with spicy marinara and lemon aioli, topped with fresno peppers $16
Bruschetta Trio: Black pepper, goat cheese, and tapenade Avocado, smoked salmon, and Crème Fraiche $21
The calamari fritti was crunchy and seasoned well. It was not oily at all. The Bruschetta was delicious as well. I recommend these 2 starters.
I had the Zuppa Del Giorno - Daily special seasonal soup $12 - which was seafood chowder. Yumm! Ingredients were fresh and very tasty!
For Main we had:
One of the day's special: Asparagus risotto with fried soft shell crabs. 2 pieces of nicely deep fried whole soft shell crabs on top of asparagus risotto.
Squid ink Capellini Di Mare Angel hair pasta tossed with fresh tomatoes, prawns, mussels, calamari and Manila clams Lg $28 Sm $21 -- the large size is good for sharing.
Costata Di Maiale - Double cut bone-in Pork chop with apple-pancetta chutney and risotto. $39
All three main were very good and I recommend all of them. The surprise was how good the pork chop was! It was juicy and tender. Very tasty!
For dessert we had tiramisu and gelato.
The staff were great -- very attentive. It's what you'd expect from a fine dining place but with a more relaxed atmosphere."

Best service ever!
Everyone that helped us (I counted about 5 people randomly attending us without care of section or status) were so detail oriented and helpful! They even did a ""Split and Marry"" with our selection of food as well since we were sharers.
The food was above average but nothing fantastic was my take away for quality of food. The price was to be expected and average for fine dining.
The atmosphere and architecture setup of the restaurant was on point to deliver the feel of quality without compromising a warm welcoming feeling. I felt comfortable and very accommodating. I have been to many places where I felt like I didn't fit in or the staff would look down on me for being a muggle in a fancy place. I never felt like that at this amazing dining experience! It felt like going to a chef's home in which you were good old friends.

My family enjoys the warm bread ad butter every time.
The only two things I wish...
-Dinner time is very noisy no matter it is weekdays or weekend. It is hard to talk at my own table. I prefer to come on the weekday for a late lunch.
-I wish to have the squid ink pasta not the angle hair style. I want a thicker texture than the thin hair.

First Impressions/Backstory: Came to this place many months ago and was turned away because didn't have reservations. Called this place last week and spoke to someone who set up a table for 2, which was very nice. Came to the place and sat down, one of the waitress came to us and 'roared'.. 'Do You have reservations ?'. Felt odd to be welcomed that way - told her the name of the person I spoke to and Thank God she went away and WASN'T our waitress. The rest of the evening went well...
II. Overall: Cozy Ambience and Decent Food
III. The Food: Had heard a lot about this restaurant being the authentic Italian experience in Issaquah and so came to see for ourselves.. we ordered:
- Osso Bucco: Done well with the Bone Marrow intactt. Subtle Taste and mildly flavored. Nothing popped for me in terms of taste
- Penne Pasta: This was done very well. The balance between sauce and the flavors was good, not to mention the pasta itself done very well
- Home Made Tiramisu: Good Taste, softly flavored
IV. Service and Ambience:
- Service: Our waitress was super nice, very attentive and the exact opposite of the waitress who we had the misfortune of speaking to earlier and spoke like it was an inquisition.
- Ambience: This is a small cozy joint in downtown Issaquah. Thru the extent of the entire night Tony was on the Guitar and kept singing various Italian and other songs. He was very gracious, came to our table and took our request - made a big difference towards the overall dinner experience
V. Price Point: Average price of an entre is around $25 with highest priced item closed to $40 as well as a stellar collection of wines and more. There are better places that serve better Italian food and less expensive though.."
"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Tim O.","The best dining experience in the Puget Sound region is in Issaquah. The food was amazing. The staff were amazing. The owner spoke with each guest and was available continuously. I could lavish about the Marsala Short Rob Ravioli or the masterpiece of a Sampler Platter but the experience is what I am most effected by.
You will need reservations. Because of this, you will notice most of the dining room will be seated within a short timeframe. You'll hear other conversations and soon wine and appetizers flow through the room. The air fills with laughter and warmth and then the entrees start to come out. The food is celebrated as it's delivered to each table and neighboring tables are showing each other the incredible presentation of each bowl or plate.
All along every need is anticipated and each guest feels invited. We can't wait to go back!"
"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Huong L.","I heard of this place for a while and since it was on SRW, I figured it would be a good opportunity to check it out. The place is a little out of main Issaquah but it's nice cause you can find parking better.
When you walk in, you get greeted by the owner himself who checks on if you have reservations or not. Once you get seated, the waiter comes out to give you your menu to look at.
We got:
Gnocchi - super yummy, soft and the sauce was delicious.
Wild boar pappardelle - the pasta was a little over done for me but the sauce was delicious. You actually get pieces of wild boar. The plate itself was simple but it was delicious.
Canolli - the cream was to die for. The canolli itself was a little soft because it was dipped in chocolate. I wish it wasn't dipped in chocolate but it was still good.
We also got a Caesar salad from the regular menu and it was good as well. The complimentary bread was probably one of the highlights, it was soft and really good flavoring.
The only thing: they asked if we wanted distilled water or sparkling water. We chose sparkling but didn't realize it cost us $4.50 for the bottle. I wish they told us in the beginning.
Besides that, everything was good and I'm definitely happy that there's a good Italian restaurant in Issaquah"

My boyfriend and his family came here for his birthday dinner from a recommendation. The service here is top notch and I had one of the best services from the waitress here. We had a table of 7 people and the waitress brought our appetizer in two separate plates without us even asking so that it's easier for all of us to share. She was also very patient in answering our questions as we're not familiar with italian food.
Everything we ordered was amazing! Everyones number one favorite dish was the lobster pasts (they don't skimp on the seafood). Everyone elses second favorite was the meatball pasta, although my second was the seafood pasts. The meatballs were gigantic and had so much flavor! It was filled with a lot of vegetables and etc. The seafood pasta was a pink sauce, also very flavorful and filled with lots of seafood!
At the end of our meal the waitress brought out a bright hat and a glass of moscato for everyone (on the house) along with the guitarist singing happy birthday to us in italian.
This is the perfect place if you want to enjoy authentic tasty italian food with the best service. The restaurant is small which makes your experience more intimate. Thank you Montalicino Ristorante Italiano for your amazing food and service!"
"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Ivy L.","Solid 4.5 stars for this restaurant! It was a cozy intimate atmosphere with the red brick walls and the candlelight.. we had a party of 6 and they sat us in the ""mafia room"" which was a semi-private room on the back with the wine.. we didn't mind it one bit. It made our bday dinner a bit more private. The owners introduced themselves to us and they are so charming and sweet. They were so friendly that you can't help but immediately love them. The husband and wife team just recently took over the restaurant and it looks like they're doing something right cause the food is amazing.
We were greeted with some sparkling wine while we waited for our table to clear. We had reservations and the people were just finishing up when we arrived. No big deal since the restaurant is a bit on the smaller side. We were seated and started with the antipasto - wow what a plate! They charge you per person on this, which is why we had so much food! There were meats and cheeses, bruschetta, tomatoes and bufala mozzarella, giant shrimps, olives, etc. It was a lot, to the point where I wish we had less cause I didn't want to ruin my appetite for all the delicious pastas! The antipasto was delicious though and they packed it up for us to-go!
Pasta dishes, we sort of went family styled and chose a few dishes to share! We ordered:
*both salads - the Caesar and the mixed greens.. both were good. Nothing to complain about here.. though they were on the smaller side so a bit more difficult to share a good portion.
*Short Rib Ravioli - yum! The pasta had a good bite and cooked perfectly al dente. I always look for this in a pasta cause it's so hard to find. The short rib was fall off the fork tender and the flavors were phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get this dish! 5/5
*Gnocchi came with a selection of a few sauces. We went for the sausage cream sauce. Again gnocchi were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious! I think one of my favorite dishes all night! 5/5
*Wild Boar Pappardelle - pappardelle is one of my favorite types of noodles! Good bite and perfectly cooked once again. Sauce was good but the other two won my vote for the night 4/5
*Pasta with Lobster in a Saffron Sauce - I think this was my least favorite dish of the night but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. It was fine, just underwhelming compared to its competitors. The lobster was lost in the dish and I felt like the flavors could be brought out more. I loved the seafood pastas in Italy, especially with the rockfish and lobster - cause omg seafood in Italy.. but the flavors of this dish didn't hit the mark. I felt like it had potential though cause I love a good saffron cream sauce! 3/5
*Homemade Cannoli, Pistachio Gelato and Tiramisu - the desserts were good but didn't blow me away! The cannoli tasted like it should. The Tiramisu needed less cream and more lady finger and espresso?! I wanted more of that kick and intense coffee and cocoa flavors. The pistachio gelato was my favorite dessert of the night. I think the dessert game could be amped up a bit, especially with the amazing pasta dishes!
Overall, I loved the food and ambiance here and have been recommending it to all my friends! Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, but remember to make reservations in advance cause it's small! Great for date nights and special occasions as well!"

"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Inge J.","Fantastic little Italian place in downtown Issaquah. Surprisingly authentic which is very rare; most ""Italian"" restaurants serve Americanized crap like ""chicken carbonara"" or ""pasta alfredo"". Had a very nice Barolo with the meal, which consisted of a house salad, lobster ravioli, and Osso buco. The lobster ravioli with a whole lobster tail was nothing short of phenomenal. Perfect balance of flavors and textures. The osso buco was equally top notch with the veal falling off the bone, super tender and flavorful. Also came with nice tomato based sauce and veggies. The after dinner grappa was on the house; nice touch.
Throughout the dinner the waitresses and manager were super friendly and attentive. There was a musician who entertained with Italian and other nice music.
I was there by myself but can see that this would be a very good place for a romantic dinner also."

"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Andrea P.","Montalcino is NOT the Montalcino that we loved before it was sold recently. We invited a couple of clients after raving about our 'favorite' Italian restaurant on the Eastside and told the waitress this was a client dinner. She immediately promoted their Barbera wine special without telling us the price and bringing out a taste and saying, ""You absolutely must try this wine!"". And because we didn't wish to look cheap we did not ask for the price and ordered a bottle, and ultimately two more glasses in which they gave one pour in one glass and only a half a pour in the 2nd because it still had 1/2 glass remaining. When the bill arrived we were charged over $60 for the bottle on 'special' and $34 for the 1 1/2 pours!
Then we ordered some of Mama's homemade cheese for an appetizer, something we always ordered in the past because we had been introduced to the previous owner's mother while she was actually making the cheese. The previous owners are neighbors of our very good friends. This is when we not only were told the restaurant had been sold, but that supposedly Momma never made the cheese! So we knew this was a bold faced lie! The cheese plate arrived and there were only 4 minute slices of cheese, barely a bite per person, when in the past it was plenty for four people!
The food was decent, but not the excellent fare we had come to expect from Montalcino, and that went for us and our non-Italian clients. Understand my family is Italian, eat fantastic Italian food at home nearly 3 days per week, we just returned from several weeks in Italy taking cooking classes in various regions, and have sampled nearly every Italian restaurant in Seattle and the Eastside.
And when we were ready to order desert we were told that we only had 10 minutes left of our allotted time on our reservation. Another first as we often had spent more time eating dinner there. It felt somewhat like eating at cafeteria.
Then the bill arrived. Including wine, appetizers, and main courses, no dessert of course, for four people, $498.95. Plus tip this felt like a lot for what we received, and were used to receiving in the past.
Big disappointment!"

The 4 of us were perfectly content standing in the hostess area listening to the sweet man playing guitar and singing. Fernando (who is the owner) personally greets everyone and he was extremely apologetic that we weren't being seated right away since we had a reservation and brought us all a glass of Prosecco which was completely unexpected and appreciated.
After being seated, we were immediately greeted and asked how our night was going. Immediately felt welcome to be sitting in her section and never felt differently. We chatted a bit and decided on the meat and cheese platter to start with a bottle of wine. Incredible flavors and they all worked so well together.
Split two entrees and we ate family style and had the Misto Mare and the 4 cheese Risotto Italiano Trio with added Italian sausage. Both dishes were extremely tasty and the balance of flavors made me want more and more.
The night will be a fond memory for the rest of our lives as the entire experience was impeccable. Cant wait to go back!"

a bunch of weird dishes.

"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Matt C.","Great expectations. We have been to the Beverly Hills location and had very high expectations coming here. We walked in and waited at the Host Stand. Three employees, one of them a manager, walked up to the station, looked at a paper, turned and walked away. NOT ONE PERSON said hello or even made eye contact.
The waiter was more like a part timer. She was friendly, but was paying more attention to something else.
The food was mediocre at best. Not bad enough to complain about, but certainly not even close to Beverly Hills. The saving grace was the complimentary bread - it was Great.
The waiter realized that we got the short end of the service and brought us a complimentary dessert - which was wonderful but it was too late.
Il Fornaio has a great reputation - like I said the Beverly Hills location is AWESOME. But here in Seattle it was very disappointing and they charge the same prices."

My significant other and I came here for an early dinner and I was bit hesitant to try the place out, only because it's located in a mall. With that being said, it really is a great spot to wine and dine.
My partner and I ordered a pasta and pizza dish, so that we could both try each. I had the spinach ravioli, he had the pork sauce based pizza - the exact name is escaping me at the moment. Regardless, holy-moly they were so good! Great flavor for both entrees and we spoiled ourselves with dessert.
Our servers were very knowledgeable of wine pairings, as well as suggestion entree food options. I love leaving a restaurant feeling spoiled and well taken care of and that is exactly what I can say about this place."
"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ryan S.","Food: 6/10
Service: 4/10
Atmosphere: 6/10
Il Fornaio in Seattle is, unfortunately, pretty forgettable. It's possibly a touch above Maggiano's or Carrabba's, but there's not a lot to say about this location. They seem to be somewhat stuck between authenticity and Americanized Italian, and ultimately fall between the cracks as a result. I would think that, being so close to an oceanic coast and having so much fresh seafood available, the restaurant should focus on highlighting the advantages of its location (understanding that it is a small chain). Service was inattentive and could easily have sold my group some appetizers, but seemed more interested in watching the bread cook and gossip, so we didn't indulge."
"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer S.","Restaurant is beautiful. Staff is very helpful, professional and attentive. I was not surprised by the prices, however, I was surprised by the food. The entrees had by my husband and myself were so bland. That coupled with the crazy price tag was a huge disappointment.

"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","L W.","Made a reservation for 8 and the host asked me if it was a special occasion. I told him that it was a ""why yes it was, my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary"" When we arrived I reminded the host that it was a 50th wedding anniversary. They walked past the center table set for 8 and stuck us in a corner next to the kitchen. (That other table was finally filled with 6 people about an hour later). I think they looked at our mixed race family (white, black and Hispanic) and judged us that we shouldn't be in the center of their nice space. Another AA couple was stuck in a corner.
The waiter was nice but didn't say happy anniversary or talk to my in-laws at all even though I told him that we were celebrating such a big event. The host did not seem like he was making it special as I hoped the waiter would.
After we ordered appetizers, drinks and dinner (they forgot my steak knife and made my husband get up to finally get me one because my butter knife wouldn't cut it-I happily tried) the waiter asked if we wanted dessert. I said yes and he brought me a menu. I finally asked, do you do anything for ""special occasions because you guys asked me if it was and marked it on our reservation?"" He said 'oh yeah. We could give you a spamoni gelato ' ok. So I ordered a few more desserts so we could all share some.
Not once did this restaurant make our special occasion special. I told the young, dumb and broke host that his table choice was rude. We might not look like we are well off or tip well but we DO and even if we didn't it's their integrity in their service, (btw-I tipped 20% because it was work to serve 8 people and I'm not rude). Also my medium rare steak was not red at all in the center. I didn't want to dampen the night. I will be calling the manager but I doubt he/she cares. We shall see if they even respond on Yelp.
Update : the manager doesn't seem to care that we came for a 50th wedding anniversary nor that they asked but treated us like we should be sat by the kitchen and not treated kindly or like the special occasion that it was. My in-laws are the kindest people. Too bad no response. Changed from 2 to 1 star 2/5/19 after no response from the manager."

"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Trisha F.","I once turned down a date here because I was like, ""Uh, a mall restaurant? Gross."" My loss, because now I've finally eaten here I realize not all mall restaurants are created equal.
We came in on the late side for dinner, and our server was very nice and flexible with our annoying orders and additions--lactose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, just a lot of special dietary needs.
Ended up trying the cucumber cooler cocktail, Margherita pizza, Caesar salad, meat ravioli, and goat cheese flatbread appetizer. Family got the white chicken rigatoni pasta and the seafood sampler dish, which came with two kinds of fish, shrimp, calamari, and a veggie side. The dishes are expensive--more than 20 a pop so it adds up fast, but they were relatively good. I say I'd probably skip the ravioli next time. The pasta was too firm and there weren't enough to warrant 22.50 price tag. Since every main is about the same price, I feel like even the white chicken pasta bowl was a better deal.
The flatbread was good. Crisp and topped with tomatoes and red onion. Cucumber cocktail was weak. The best looking dish was the fish sampler. Pizza is typical Neapolitan, so soggy/soft and wasn't the best leftovers. Their bread and oil/vinegar is delicious--the bread has a great crust and the inside is so tender...it's delicious and wonderful for sopping up extra sauces from your main.
Overall I was happy with dinner and I'd come back to try other food and have wine over cocktails."

Why? Unacceptable. No reason to turn down business when there are plenty of empty tables. I looked at the dining room, then looked at him like he was nuts - but he offered no explanation. Perhaps the host did me a favor by letting me walk out, without any offer to stay not even for drink at the bar. I honestly wouldn't mind a wait under 15 minutes, but there was no justification for this. I have never wrote a review without tasting food first, but will do so whenever I receive piss poor, uncaring service like this, especially without even sitting down."

We had a sleeping child in a stroller and were looking for somewhere we could take the stroller, unfolded, inside. They were completely understanding on this point and seated us in quiet corner with our stroller.
My butternut squash ravioli with fried sage leaves was excellent. The dish featured large, soft, homemade pillows of pasta and there was a circle of very fresh tomato sauce in the middle. They kept the fried sage leaves out of the sauce so that they were crispy and easily paired with a bite of ravioli. I especially loved that touch.
My husband's Tagliatelle Bolognese was very good as well.
Lastly, we were very impressed by the kindness of the staff. We would definitely make another visit in the future."
"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jesena M.","We've been here twice so far, it is close to Paramount and we park in the same building anyway. I'd love to give them a 3.5*, but I feel 3 is too low and they are not quite a 4.
We both had pasta and pizza both times, I wasn't too impressed with the pizza the last time, this time around was better. We both really enjoyed their pasta dishes (Penne vodka and butternut squash with brown butter and sage). We also decided to order an appetizer salad plate, which was nice, but could have used a little more something. It was plain lettuce with some parmesan shavings, I think a couple of tomatos, olives and other items could have added to it. The salad was too simple for the price we paid.
Service is always slow, we got seated and someone brought us water, another person a basket of bread and than no one else came for about 15-20min at least? We didn't know who our waiter was, so we emptied the bread basket and were just about done once the waiter showed up. He seemed stressed, even though there wasn't too much going on yet when we arrived.
Overall a decent option, but it isn't the high end italian experience I was hoping for."

Went here again last night and dined in their dining room right next to the dessert cart!
We ordered:
- squid ink pasta with salmon, shrimp, clams, and mussels $23
- risotto
- calamari
- mixed charcuterie board
The squid ink pasta was pretty good! It was my first time trying squid ink pasta and I really enjoyed it. the sauce was light and their was plenty of seafood in the dish.

I ordered carbonara, first of all it's not the traditional carbonara, it's weird to use this type of pasta, there were some water left in the pasta and made my dish very watery, I am glad they made it al dente, but there was no flavor at all. On the other hand, the bacon is full with flavor, I personally loved it but it's so greasy and did not mix well with the pasta. It is kinda of awkward to eat this dish, so be prepared to eat it with forks and knife. My friend ordered the same dish, he has the same opinion.
The homemade tiramisu is okay, It's also not traditional tiramisu that tastes like coffee, it tasted citrus instead,I could not taste the coffee, the cake a little dry, and it's too sweet!
The environment is pretty nice and there's a cute tree in the middle.

"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tim G.","My wife and I met up with friends at Agrodolce for Seattle Restaurant Week. We started with a bottle of wine that was a little too acidic. After 30 minutes our appetizers showed up. Two of us ordered the mushroom arancini. It said foraged and found mushrooms. I guess the foraging didn't go well, because we didn't find any mushroom flavor. My wife ordered the local roots beet salad. They brought her the arancini as well and did not seem to believe her when she said she had ordered the beet salad. We all heard her say it. I am not sure why the waiter did not. Another twenty minutes and her salad showed up.
My wife enjoyed her salad. After another 30 minutes the entrees were served. My Braised Lamb was quite good. My wife's choice Bucatini Sarde was not bad. The other two in our party had the Chestnut Rigatoni. It was flavorless and the gluten free pasta was quite awful. They did not ask for gluten free pasta, that is all that was offered with the dish.
For dessert, three of us had the Theo's Chocolate Caramel Budino, which was very tasty, but served with a tablespoon that was larger than the ramekin.
In the two hours we were there, the waiter only spoke to us to take the original order, doubt that my wife had ordered the beet salad and mumble thanks when he dropped off the bill. Was it because we spoke Spanish or because of the order mixup? No, he seemed to be that way with everyone. He clearly did not want to be there. No problem, the place was half empty on restaurant week. We won't be back again. Soon enough he'll likely have his wish and not have to be there anymore."

The service was really slow even though there were barely anyone in for lunch, and in the two hours we were there our server didn't ask about the food once. We had to wait for while for our food too, and when he came back it was only to refill our waters and give us the check.
In terms of food, I had the daily special salad, which had an arugula and red cabbage base with almonds, figs, burrata cheese and grilled chicken (added for $4 more). I thought this was a very innovative salad and liked it very much - the only thing I was missing was a little more acidity from the dressing. I think they should have added a bit more of that. My chicken was also good but a little burnt, and they used chicken breast that wasn't boneless, so there was less meat than it looked like.
I wasn't able to take a proper look at the rest of the menu since we ordered rather quickly (the server came back very fast and my coworkers that had been there before us already knew what they wanted), so I might come back to sample that since I love Italian food. But it won't be my first pick."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elyse M.","I came here with a friend because she was trying to use a gift $50 gift card before leaving the area.
We arrived right as they opened and no one was in the restaurant besides us for the first 15 to 30 minutes we were there. The waitress took a while to take our order and the food took a bit longer than I'd expect given that no one else was there.
I ordered a smaller pasta for $16, my friend ordered a larger pasta plate, and we ordered focaccia with oil to reach that $50 mark.
The food was good. The olive oil had a little too much salt in it but it tasted good besides that. I couldn't really taste the pasta but the sauce was flavorful.
The portion size to price ratio is ridiculous and I would say not worth it. We did ask what the sizes were before ordering so we had a vague sense of how much we were getting. The waitress said the smaller portion was for sampling while the larger one was more of a meal. For $16 I hope you'd get more than a sample, and normally wouldn't have gone for that option, but we were trying to use the gift card, so we bought more.
When the bill came, my friend tried using the gift card and was told that the restaurant couldn't accept it because management had changed a couple months before and my friend would have to use it at (I think) Tilth.
The waitress was nice about it but the response on behalf of the restaurant seems unprofessional. There was no notice anywhere about the change in management or that the gift cards couldn't be used here. I would assume I would be able to use a gift card with the restaurant's name on it at the restaurant without having to check if it's a valid form of payment. I feel like good customer service would have been to accept the gift card and notify us for next time, especially since we bought what we did because of the gift card. This can all be chalked up to lack of communication, but as customers, this doesn't seem like a thing you'd normally have to communicate."

"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Erik S.","Like other reviews say, we had a really bad thanksgiving dinner experience. They forgot our salad, service was slow (we asked if they were understaffed and they said they were not), and portions/quality were not worth the price. The tables next to us we're both so frustrated that it made for a really bad dining experience, despite us trying to make the most of it. One table even yelled when our food arrived because they were still waiting... and they ended up getting up and leaving without paying with permission from the waiter. The waiter offered us two free glasses of wine and even ended the night by saying ""sorry we ruined your holiday""... I wouldn't have gone that far, but apparently that's how clear the experience was. Feels wrong to charge full price for an experience that apparently ruined our thanksgiving."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joseph J.","This place is a scam, and our experience was a disaster.
1. Tiny portion for the price we paid
2. Waited for almost 90mins after ordering, even though the place (I wouldn't call it a restaurant) is only about 20% full. It feels like the server is also the cook? I don't know, but I am pretty sure it would take me less time to buy the ingredients from the PCC across street and cook the dish myself.
3. The pasta tasted like yakisoba from next door, but this place charge you triple.
4. We got tricked into ordering soup/salad. Yes, there was the fine print about how much the soup/salad cost, but the way Kurt the server asked made it sounds like it was a combo that come with the pasta.
5. Kurt the sever charged us extra, both in the item price and in tax (he charged the tax based on subtotal+tips). He know we are in a rush to get back to work. The seasonal pasta got charged $1 more, and the spaghetti marinara got charged $4 more. What a scam.
6. I would like to say something to Kurt the server, but due to the general guideline of Yelp, I am not gonna say it here.
7. I hope this place get closed, so there won't be more victims from their scam.
In conclusion, come to this place if you like any of the following:
1. waste of time
2. hunger
3. being scammed
4. disaster
5. get charged unreasonably"

Today is Mother's day, and so I defer to my wife for a review of our Mother's Day pick.
It was a Prix Fixe menu. 8 of us held a table for almost 2 and a half hours while we waited for the second course to show up. The food was cooked with varying degrees of quality. My wife was steamed. We won't be returning.
They waited until we'd already been put for 2 hours before they informed us that a cook hadn't showed. For that, I will leave the waiter with a tip:
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Tell us ahead of time so my wife doesn't flip out. (^_^)"
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","L A.","Came here for thanksgiving... the only good thing about the meal was the company that I was with. The food was all cold. The salad had zero flavor. Some of the items had a strange after taste. One of the pre set dishes was no longer available. So they brought out soup instead. When I asked the waitress what kind it was, she was not sure and smelled it! The portions were extremely small and the sweet potatoes were under cooked. Everything took entirely too long to come out and when we received each course they were all slightly warm at best.
Aside from all of that, our waitress was extremely chatty and down right inappropriate. I won't get into what she said to me, but it was enough to offend me. At 115 dollars a person we all left hungry, disappointed, and I left offended. Over all this was the worst dinner experience of my 38 years of life."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Geri Ann B.","I usually love Agrodolce! But this was the first time with its executive chef Thomas Litrenta as owner - he bought the place from famed chef Maria Hines last month. It was one of my lunch picks for Seattle Restaurant Week Spring 2019. I arrived at 12:30pm, there were only six seated tables, more than a dozen open tables, yet I stood waiting at the front for almost five minutes. There was only one person managing front of house and table service, he needed help. Even though there were many wide open tables he said there might be a wait because it was Seattle Restaurant Week and they were holding a lot of tables (I note that no one else showed up after me, and lunch service ended at 2:00pm). Luckily he sat me anyway. The appetizer dish of grilled asparagus with pepper sauce and homemade burrata was the best appetizer of all SRW offerings I had during the week. I could have eaten three servings of it. The server/host recommended the tomato rigatoni entree and is was, sadly, very disappointing and downright not good. The sausage was overcooked and hard, the pasta might have been good but the texture was like it was overboiled and then sat under a heat lamp for too long, strangely tough on the surface even though mushy on the inside. Then as you reached the bottom, there was just too much oil/sausage fat pooled at the bottom of the dish to be appetizing.
I love this place normally, so it had to be an off day, but SRW should put better since I think the idea is to capture people who might not otherwise try a place. I'd hate to think that someone might think this was their best foot forward."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Geoff L.","Went there for Thanksgiving, the worst meal we have ever had. First, my wife told them she was a vegetarian in the reservations, to our waiter when we sat down after he asked and they still served salad with bacon on it. When she said something, the waiter said that is how it comes, they did take care of her after she looked at him and said I can't eat this. After almost 2 hours our turkey finally came, I thought my first bite was raw so I mentioned it to the couple that was with us. When one of them shined his cell phone light on it, it was raw. He called the waiter in and he took it back to the kitchen. They offered us another plate but we were already going on 2.5 hours. The sweet potatoes were crunchy too, not at all cooked. Since desert finally came after 2.5 hours after we got there, we took it in a box to go.
They did comp our dinner but it was the worst dinning experience I have ever had, will never go back."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Anna G.","My team and I had lunch today at Agrodolce and I would not recommend it. There were 12 or so of us and maybe 4 other people in the restaurant. We were greeted by the owner/chef/server....which was interesting.
Most of us ordered the house salad w/a protein. It took over an hour for our meals to arrive - we were there a total of 2. I found two human hairs in salad & two other attendee's also found hair in their entree's. Not only did we not receive an apology but our entree's were not taken off the final bill. Further, the food that was delivered without issues, was ok at best. Not sure if they were having an off day or what but I would not recommend this place.

Food was not at all up to expectations. There was something wrong with every course. The pastry on the Caramelized onion tart was raw in the middle and under cooked. The pasta course had ZERO seasoning. We had to request salt to give it any flavor. The turkey roulade was COLD in the middle. The sweet potatoes needed a glaze or something - they were just cut into non-uniform sizes and under roasted, hard and not completely cooked. The cannoli were all different shapes and sizes - some big, some small; some undercooked, some overcooked. Spent over $300 for dinner for two (included drinks) on Thanksgiving and we were completely disappointed. Will not return."

The service was attentive (automatic 20 % tip added to the bill by the restaurant). Total for two people for the prix fixe menu with two glasses of wine ($13 each) came up to $228. The food was good, but in very little quantity. It was not worth the price. Thus my rating."

The place didn't look too busy so we decided to eat here after our original lunch out location was too crowded. We ordered and we waited for almost an hour and a half. I ordered the seasonal pasta special and when it finally arrived I was disappointed that it tasted less like an italian dish and more like something you could buy from panda express for a third of the price. The portion size was not satisfactory. When we got the bill we were also pretty sad to see that the soup was not included as a combo with the meal adding insult to injury. I went in hungry, and left hungry with a savage hole in my wallet.
Turn around if you're thinking of trying this place for lunch."

We started with the Caramelized Broccoli, toasted almond, chili flake, anchovy vinaigrette. This is a special of the house and it was excellent. The portion could have served 4....so we took home what we didn't eat.
For our entree we had the Squid Ink Chitarra, dungeness crab, preserved lemon, pickled pepper and bottarga. Very different and excellent.
Our second entree was Coffee Flour Pappardelle & Sugo....beef, pork, lamb, hourse marinara, mama lil's peppers....excellent. We shared some of each entree. Two very different flavors.
For desert we shared the Lemonchelo Tieramisue which we shared and was excellent."

All were extremely delicious - the type of food you slow down to enjoy."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Erin G.","This place has a lot of potential. It gives off the vibe of a very indulgent restaurant -- the pasta is freshly made and the menu is seasonal, so every visit will be different. However, it's a bit expensive, which might be why whenever I go it feels like we're one of two couples in the restaurant!
1 large pasta and 1 small pasta is a perfect portion to share for two people. The pasta is always delicious -- my first visit I felt I had the best bolognese of my life. You will want to also get an order of bread.. not only is it great, but it will help you clean up the last of your yummy pasta sauce.
All in all, would recommend a visit for a fancy and intimate dinner date."

Bad Service!!
3rd Visit ... I'm so bummed I really liked this place but they have a serving problem. I originally gave this place a five star but on my second visit did not receive any service it was as if the serving staff were in a fight and no one was going to wait on this one table which is where we were seated. Definitely one of the most awkward visits to a restaurant ever. We waited so long we eventually had to excuse ourselves and leave with no service no one even tried to stop us to apologize. This was my husband's birthday. Prices these days are so high you can't risk inconsistency. I'll leave my original review below.
Food made with love in West Seattle. We had breakfast. Nice atmosphere! Windows open and fresh bread! Best mushroom frittata"

Well now the food.. we ordered the lasagna this was really delicious and fresh tomatoes you could tell it from the flavors.. we then ordered the spring lamb and pinochio pizzas and both the pizzas were great i liked the spring lamb a tad more than the pinocchio just cos of the pesto basil it tasted really good.. unfortunately i did not have time to try their desserts but will stop by again to dry their desserts.. good spot in california ave area.."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Sheila G.","Food was pretty good, but service is terrible. Both times I've been here the service has been awful.
The first time I went, we ordered 10 minutes before happy hour. Instead of the server telling us HH started in ten minutes, he made sure we ordered prior so we'd have to pay full price.
The second time I went with a larger party. Anytime we'd ask for something (like a photo or a candle in the dessert) the waitress would act annoyed like we were wasting her time.
If service were better I'd give this place a 3.5. They have a few really good pizzas, but they're salads aren't anything special."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Roger B.","I was surprised when Mioposto came to North Admiral as we already had a brick oven pizzeria and a number of other pizzeria venues. Somehow they've fit in and seem to be busy. Of benefit is their location. A nice brick building that is the last restaurant heading North on California. It's well decorated and has a nice ambience inside including a large glimmering painting of horses on the wall. (I think one of the horses is missing a leg.)
I like meat so the Pinocchio is the pizza for me. The crust is crisp yeasty with a light sweetness. When I'm in for cheese, I love the Quattro Formaggi with milled tomatoes. I don't like clams here as much as some of my friends do as I prefer a red sauce with my bivalves. The lasagna is quite good. Baked in the same brick oven as the pizza.
Service has been solid."

"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Sheri C.","Finally able to dine at Mioposto after a couple failed attempts due to my impatience of not wanting to wait for over 1 hour for a table, I was really pleased!
A friend chose Mioposto to celebrate her birthday. A couple of us got together with her. We shared their antipasti plate of goat cheese, olive tapenade, agro dolce, roasted and marinated eggplant, prosciutto and arugula with bread. The cheese was really good and the prosciutto was perfection. I got the lamb pizza, which comes with onion, goat cheese (had a lot of goat cheese that night), roasted red peppers and mint. I really liked the lamb; I ended up picking off the peppers. The mozzarella was divine. A friend got a pepperoni pie while the other ordered lasagna. The person who ordered the pepperoni commented that the crust was a bit burnt but frankly I think he wasn't use to a wood fired crust; it didn't look burnt to me but I wasn't eating it either.
The server offered a free dessert to the birthday girl, so she got tiramisu and loved it. I ordered their apple crostada and asked for the vanilla ice cream to be on the side because it was freezing cold in there. As soon as I ordered it that way, I realized how illogical that was. Go figure.
Mioposto is decorated in a really pleasing way. It's a small dining area with a couple booths, a few tables and a long communal table in the center. Their bar has sports going but not loudly. The lighting is cool. There's a giant horse mural on one wall that is pretty sweet.
Parking in this neighborhood sucks, but that is West Seattle for you. If you can't find a spot on the street, because there is no lot here, drive up the road to Safeway and park there then walk a couple blocks.
Our waiter/server was also that night's bartender. He kept good tabs on us even though he was wearing multiple hats.

Something is always off when I come to this one, & this past Saturday was no exception. While the pizza was fine, the greens in my beet salad were so slimy. The salad had definitely been made far ahead of my ordering it. The music they were playing incredibly dorky & soft, almost Christian sounding pop. (According to Shazam, one of the bands was called The Script?) Unfortunately, it got on my nerves so badly, I had a panic attack. My brain chemistry is NOT their fault, but throughout the meal, we were both so completely turned off by the music. Why not just play some whatever downtempo instead of something some customers would find obnoxious? In all of the years I've been eating there (primarily at the one in Mount Baker), I've never heard anything like it. Imagine the soundtrack from a Hallmark movie. Luckily, my attack happened after we had signed our bills, & that was that."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Audrey C.","This is our favorite pizza spot in West Seattle.

My favorite pizzas are the Spring Lamb and Zucca Balsamica, but I've enjoyed every pizza we have tried there; except the Egg and Pancetta pizza was a bit too spicy for my tastes.
Great spot!"

"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Wennie H.","Man, I love Mioposto for dinner but brunch was incredible. Honestly can't believe how blown away we were by the food. We love their pizza and the brunch options were just perfect. Morning service was a little hectic (one server) but she was super friendly and helpful.
We got the Stromboli (basically a margherita pizza with eggs, caramelized onions and potato folded in half). It was delicious, I think it could have used a bit more sauce but it wasn't dry by any means. It wasn't overwhelming salty or anything, a bit on the blander side but still good. My favorite was the pananata (chopped up French toast topped with apple cinnamon and powdered sugar). It was SO GOOD. I know at some point I'll have to use other words but words are escaping me. It wasn't too sweet, but sweet enough that I didn't need syrup. I literally ate the whole plate because despite my gf saying it was good, she isn't a huge fan of sweets....and I tried to tell myself to not eat it all but my self control isn't too strong.
We opted for no pancetta and they didn't have any subs but it was fine. Also ordered a coffee and a side of hashbrowns (gf said hashbrowns were really good).
Price point was good. Not expensive at all and super affordable. Our new favorite brunch spot and right down the street!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Christina H.","After going to Mioposto in Mt. Baker, we gave the Alki location a try (it was closer to where we were staying anyways). It was also a good option, although the Mt. Baker location is in a way better setting. This one was at least not in the busy downtown Alki area, so parking was easier than we expected (but still took a bit of searching).
We ordered similar items as what we had at the Mt. Baker location (I got the beet salad, margarita pizza but I added mushrooms this time, and WA red blend; my husband got the caesar, pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side, but tried a medium colored nitro beer). The food was relatively consistent; something about the beet salad at the Mt. Baker location was better (I think the almonds were more finely ground and there were more beets). We also had to get normal size pizzas since we missed the timeframe for the salad/pizza special, and those were nice. I forgot to order extra crispy, so I highly recommend doing that (makes it well done all the way through - definitely way better!). The basil on my pizza was not shredded like at the other location, totally minor, but I wasn't as big of a fan of that. Also, the mushroom topping is called a ""mushroom trio,"" and it was actually just one kind of mushroom (crimini). Again nothing super big, but just a little confusing as ""trio"" means ""three."" My husband loved the nitro beer and said it was super smooth (I apologize for not remembering the exact name, but it was a medium brown and not hoppy at all).
The service wasn't as great as Mt. Baker. It might have been the time we were there (late 3's/early 4's). Our waitress was busy doing other things (appeared to be prepping for the dinner crowds), so there were long periods of waiting. We didn't mind since we were just relaxing. Eventually another waiter took over. Not the same attentiveness as the other location, but still not bad.
At the end of the day, the food was still great. If I had the opportunity to choose between the different locations, I think it's obvious what my pick is (Mt. Baker), but again, this location isn't bad."

This place gets busy so I recommend getting an app that can save you a spot in line which is what we did and showed up just in time after the dinner rush had finished. The venue is extremely cute/quaint, perfect for the ultimate date night- cool signage, unique hanging lights, lots of brick bordered by wood.
We started out with the recommended wine for the evening and were very happy with the decision- I could tell they knew their stuff in that regard. We split the oven-roasted clams which were amazingly buttery but with that slight brightness that the wine and parsley added. Would have liked a little more bread with it to soak up all the amazing juices but we definitely made do. We split the formosa for dinner which is a perfect go to classic pizza that would make anyone happy- the olives were a great touch of saltiness. Finished it off with a little bit of ice cream to sooth my sweet tooth and was perfectly content.
Basically the only reason I didn't give 5 full stars is that service was a little slow towards the end of our meal despite there not being that many patrons- might have been a little short staffed?
All in all, would love to come back to Seattle to try out their other unique pizzas!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Richard G.","The one star is far too good for them. Average food but the worst service in America. We came, as a group of 7 , and waited nearly an hour, until we realized they were never going to serve us. We were a group of drs and older and obviously not welcome.
The servers were at best nasty and unfriendly and should not be in this industry. There is no excuse for their behavior...
I cannot imagine how anyone could leave a tip.
Awhile later:
The owner/manager reached out to me and was very gracious. He reviewed my concerns and was very reassuring about addressing the matter in the future. So
I was very involved by his involvement.
For my part, I think I should be more careful about going to places with large groups:many restaurants cannot handle them without prior notice."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Brad H.","Fantastic happy hour. The Rosemary flat bread was my favorite- full of flavor and good serving size.

"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Katherine G.","Mioposto is my favorite pizza place in Seattle! Their happy hour is amazing and has a ton of options for food! It's definitely a treat to go to Mioposto because most places in Seattle haven't figured out how to make good wood fired pizza! Their wine is nice and so are their cocktails. I highly recommend Mioposto! :)"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Mahsa S.","the pizza is absolutely delicious! I got the Quattro formaggi and the hint of lemon was a great touch. a bit on the pricey side but worth it. the pizzas are 12"" and could probably be split between two people if wanted, but if you're hungry enough it's good for one"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","B K.","While I adore Mioposto's food and atmosphere, there is one special reason I love to return: Wendy! If you haven't been blessed to encounter Wendy as your server you are missing the most magnificent, dynamic, friendly, and gregarious server ever! Wendy's charisma and utter joyfulness can turn a grey Seattle afternoon into a burst of pure radiant sunshine.
To me, this is the treasure of Mioposto.
When I leave the restaurant I have a satisfied tummy and a smile on my face!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Nikki H.","Finally got to check out Mioposto on a Tuesday night and so glad we did. It was busy and we were able to get the last table available. They have tons of vegetarian options which is always a plus in my book. Offer happy hour and parking isn't bad.
For A cocktail I ordered the lavender French 75, it was so refreshing and tasty. We started out with the Roasted Beet Salad that had different Lettuces, goat cheese and almonds. It was so good I wished that we ordered a bigger one! For pizza we chose the La Bianca which had shredded mozzarella, goat cheese, caramelized onion, garlic, chili flakes and fresh arugula. We were planning on only having a few slices but ended up eating the whole thing because it was so darn good!
Overall the food and service was great! The prices are on the higher end for the amount of food you get but I think it's worth it."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Helen T.","I try to eat 98% plant based (""vegan"") but this certainly did not fit that category. Mioposto did not have any specifically vegan options which was a little disappointing, they did say that I could request their vegetarian pizzas without cheese, but because I was on vacation in Seattle I decided to full send the cheese. I haven't broken my veganism often (only once before) over these past 4 years, but I'd say this cheese lasagna was (maybe) worth it. The sauce however was my favorite part, so maybe they could incorporate that into a vegan dish in the future. Really great atmosphere."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Brittani S.","Should definitely come and check out their lunch combo; a salad and a pizza for about $13, or during happy hour for discounted apps and entrees. Both deals for great for the quality and amount of food you get."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Melissa R.","We were so excited to try this place after reading the reviews, but sadly it fell short. We were there during a very busy time on Saturday night. We're really patient people, no issue with waiting, but you could tell the staff was bey overwhelmed with the volume of in house and to go orders.
We watched our pizza come out of the oven, by the time it was delivered it was cold. No exaggeration, cold. The middle of the pizza had also sogged up a bit from sitting.
The pizza was delicious. I can only imagine how much I would've been raving about this place had my food been warm. We might've sent it back, but by the time someone came to see how it was, we were hungry so had already eaten quite a bit.
We may give them another shot, but would definitely avoid that peak dinner time on the weekend."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Sydney S.","Happy hour was incredible! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, friendly staff. Highly recommend and I'll be back! Lamb pizza was unbelievable!!!!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Jen K.","I have been to Mioposto a fair number of times because we live close by. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this restaurant, but I am happy to have it in the neighborhood as an easy, go-to, kid-pleaser type of place. The food is solid. If you are low carb you can get the eggplant Parmesan (it's also gluten free), and a side salad. Otherwise, people mostly come here for the pizzas. It can be hard to bring a group larger than 4-5 because it's a fairly small restaurant, but I was able to get a large table for a party of 8 one time, on the day of Husky game no less! I actually prefer Mioposto for brunch, because they have one of the best Bloody Marys in Seattle (and a pretty good Italian style frittata)."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Clint W.","I think this is a hidden place and I liked it.
We made it for HH, had a great pizza with an egg on it. House red? Check. I thought the staff was friendly and she came by to let get a second round before HH expired.
Its pretty small, and definitely has a neighborhood vibe to it. But I am coming again."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Lauren R.","This is the best pizza I've ever had in the states, on par with Italian pizza. The pizzas are wood fired and fresh with amazing combinations. I believe we got the Prosciutto e Arugula and Le Patate Con Tartufo. I dream about this pizza! The service was excellent with our waiter being very friendly and attentive. The tiramisu was delicious as well!"

"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Robert V.","I just had the best experience at Bar Taglio. Nice people (thank you Lindsey and Veronica) and delicious food and drink. I was in a rush to make a ferry, so had one cocktail and a piece of pizza. The vesper was perfect and the pizza - Roman style with Bainbridge Island made guanciale - carbonara was incredible. I can't wait to spend a little more time there.
---------
So another trip to Bar Taglio, where once again I'm amazed by the service, food and drink. What a a awesome spot. Thing is I know how hArd it is to a achieve consistency, but each time I drop in the only sad part is leaving."
"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Erica W.","I discovered this place after visiting a Skin care clinic next door. Located in the exchange building, this cute little bar is a perfect spot for a little post work happy hour!
They have a full bar, if that's what you're into. They have a small but decent tap list; all of which were all local, and no crap on tap. There's also wine options, but isn't that a given?
Let me get to this pizza. I haven't stopped talking about it since I visited.
My friend and I each got a few different slices.
I got the Potate (potato) pizza. The rosemary and potato were the perfect combo!
My second piece was a prosciutto pizza. It was pretty good, but the potato pizza was the clear winner in the head to head!
My friend had gotten a few options (fungi & squash) which was more adventurous than this picky eater was willing to try. She spoke highly about them, but I can't personally vouch.
This place is great, although a little expensive for a HH. My bill was close to $50. Kind of a bougie HH if you ask me. However, the service was great, and the pizza was delicious - so I didn't mind spending a little more.
Definitely will be back for more of that BOMB Potate pizza!"
"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cara L.","This review is for cocktails only.
I stopped in the other day for a meeting and had a great bar experience. I opted for the logatto and it was so delicious. The bartender described it as a salty dog, but with tequila. And it was similar, but way better. I think it was the truffle salt that put it over the edge.
The service was super friendly, but not too clingy. And the food I saw come out of the kitchen looked really tasty.
I can't wait to come back!"
"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jason P.","I always have preferred the square style pizza over other slices weather it is a grandma's style or the Roman style pie so when Bar Taglio opened couple of blocks from my work place I had to try it out.
Right next to cafe hitchcock in the exchange building on first avenue, it's pretty easy to get to though parking may be a little hard around this area.
The restaurant is really nice, the standard mix of comfy bar and industrial feel of Seattle. There is a long bar with some more high table bar seating, normal tables and booths.
The service was good and fairly attentive though the pizza came out a little slow even though I came at around one and there was a few other customers.
Order two different slices, a margarita and a bologna. Both were very good though I prefer a more doughy crust. The crust was more crispy and air but that just my personal preference. Will definitely be back to try there other pizza options and the other things on the menu."
"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","L L.","So glad I found this spot. It's a relatively new restaurant in Seattle the food is spot on"
"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ron G.","We have been watching this place around the corner and finally got a moment to give a go. Wow! Amazing food, great wine list including many wonderful selections from Italy, France and beyond.

"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Terrence M.","'Taglio' means cut, clip, slice, etc.
Truly and humbly, I will not say this lightly. You could have fooled me that this is a restaurant that has only been open for one week.
There are many well established restaurants doing great food and good deeds in sometimes unusual and sometimes predictable ways. Taglio doesn't care. Bar Taglio doesn't seem to care that it lacks the generic lingo and speak of PNW restaurants. No hipster stares, weird mustaches, ""farm to table"" or ""bottles and cans"" corny and canned, copycat menu references here. Taglio doesn't seem to think it's service be new or novice or a work in progress. This is a baby who never crawled! The service I have received on two visits, on back-to-back days has rivaled and already surpassed 90 percent of all restaurants in Seattle.
It's not trying to be perfect but it is certainly trying not to be lazy! Not a lazy bone! Shot out to members Jack, Shiori, and Alex for outstanding low-key and fierce attention to detail. These guys are a testament to the ownership, Chef and management. Did I mention they have only been open for one week? Paper menus are clean and clipped, waiters are polishing everything always, constantly polishing utensils in the open for all to see. Clean plates always, constant table attention but not in an eagerly pretentious way or for show. Go with it, encourage it.
Everything you eat with is just as clean and meticulous as what you actually eat. Roman slices of beautiful lobster mushrooms and taleggio. Crispy textures, glossy fishes, transparent sun dried raisins, fermented tart and sweet local plums, strikingly fresh parsley, radicchio and chicory leaves stacked curling upward toward heaven. First press expensive Italian olive oils generously hug and high five Italian salt.
The front and back of house duet, not duel. I love, absolutely love when chefs help expedite their food to the tables!! Here and there, chefs randomly exit double doors ferrying your selections and briefly describe them to you. They are humble in personality, wearing clean and pristine stately pinstriped aprons atop chef coats and caps. These chefs are comfortable, easy to talk to, clean, not full of tattoos and piercings, so well kept, and they know their table numbers. Such a nice and smart touch having them come out to tables and it is obvious they like it. Stunning!!
Value is keen to turn your head. For example, only $9.00 for a solid square of perfect fungi pizza with glorious chanterelle and lobster mushrooms, warm and thick taleggio, oil and herbs. An average piece of so-so pizza in Seattle is $6.00, here you get 3X the taste, quality and experience. Ambiance is simple, clean, non-distracting to your conversation and cohesive with the food's own ambiance. Perfect for an informal date, business get together and ideal for tourists who cant get a table in Seattle's most popular areas and markets. Tourists, I would convince you to see that this chef uses many of the same sources as many of the best restaurants in town but does an equal and surpassing job in using them to your delight! Come here, avoid the traffic, the wait, the clutter, you will likely have a better meal. Relax in comfortable chairs, bar stools, sofas, and enjoy your own company or come with others and talk. The music isn't too loud or offensive. The kitchen isn't open and the energy is relaxed elegance.
Stunningly simple and in their own world! I've never done this, screw it...
SIX STARS******!!!"

Stopped by for dinner on Sat on the way to the symphony. Started with the roasted cauliflower which was very tasty and some warm olives w/ herbs. We split 3 slices of pizza, all were very good and was a good amount of food for 2. Finished with a espresso martini which I'd recommit you like to drink your desert! The space is beautiful and all the people working are super friendly. I can see this place become one of my regular hangouts."

The food was absolutely delicious, from bread to dessert. The restaurant is cute, well decorated, cozy and charming. Parking is easy and plentiful.
We were lucky enough to have Leo as our server; outstanding service, great sense of humor, and ultra attentive.
This place really cares about your comfort, happiness and overall experience. One of the owners, Fernando, checked on us several times, and was so genuine in his desire to make sure we were having an amazing experience - nice touch!
We can't wait to visit again!"
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Duncan B.","I wanted so badly for this place to be good. An upscale Italian restaurant would nicely flesh out the portfolio of Renton dining options. Unfortunately, despite a charming atmosphere, the food is just bad. Overpriced and bad.
My first visit I got the veal marsala and my companion got the chicken piccata. The veal was overly thick, unevenly cooked, and came in a watery, flavorless Marsala sauce. It tasted like cafeteria Salisbury steak. The chicken was somewhat better in so much as it tasted like chicken, but it was overcooked and tough. The Caesar salad was passable but certainly nothing to write home about.
I will give them credit for having a good tiramisu. Whatever bakery they partnered with is solid. Still, it was not enough to bring redemption to this establishment. Upon receiving the bill (over $100 for this debacle) I was filled with quiet rage.
Despite all of this, I foolishly returned to give them a second try. Nope. They sucked again."
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Terri W.","We've been here twice now, and we like it.
Two dishes stand out for us: the Calamari Fritti, and the Tiramisu. My MIL got the Gamberoni Fiorentine which she really liked except that the spinach needed to be salted both times we were there. (They don't put salt on the table, so we had to ask for it to be brought, which is slightly embarrassing.) Hubs and I really love that fried calamari! We gobble it up like it's our last meal!
MIL also got the Chicken Picatta both times we were there, and she really loves it. Hubs did too. I got the Chicken Marsala on our first visit, and it was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. But in fairness to the restaurant, I need to explain. Many years ago, I tasted Chicken Marsala for the first time, and I fell in love with it. But I have never had one since then that tasted like that first one; nothing satisfies me. I'll optimistically order it on occasion, in the hope that I will love, it, but so far... no luck.
My recent main course was Alfredo with chicken. It was good, but the chicken pieces needed salt. The sauce didn't need salt, but the chicken did. (As I recall, the Marsala I ordered on my first visit also needed salt.) Hubby's recent main dish was Bolognese, which is often a favorite of his, but he said it was just okay.
On our first visit, we each got a dessert: the cannoli (no one really liked it very much), the raspberry-lemon tart (again, not that great), and the tiramisu (fantastic!). As far as we're concerned, the only dessert to get here is the excellent Tiramisu -- it's the best ever!
Both times we were there, we got seated at the same table, and had the same waiter. My MIL can be quite picky about her food preferences, and he was very accommodating. We appreciate that."
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Ryan H.","This place was packed, we had a reservation and overheard walk in's talking with the host that there was a hour and a half wait. We had a small wait and then sat. We were offed bread with a pesto butter that my daughter was obsessed with. I ordered the tortellini con salmon and 2 glasses of the only moscato on the menu, the wine was very tasty thus why the second glass. The pasta was perfect although it was a hour before we got the food. I think the kitchen it a bit small for how many people were there. That is my only knock of the place. We never had a half filled water glass that is how attentive the wait staff was. Overall food was awesome and I would come back."
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Smaly K.","It was time for a dinner date with my friend, and we usually need plenty of time to decide on where to eat. But this time, she already had this place in mind, having heard about how good this place was from her friend, so that definitely saved us the difficulty of choosing a restaurant.
She got here first and already started on the complimentary bread with the tasty flavored butter. We both started off with a glass of pinot grigio ($9 each) the Calamari Fritti ($16). The fries calamari was good with the cilantro aioli, but wasn't the greatest. My friend ordered the Linguine di Mare and I ordered the Penne con Pollo Diavola. I really enjoyed my pasta and the flavor of its garlic red pepper sauce. My friend seemed to enjoy her seafood pasta as well, since she finished it, and she doesn't finish all her food too often. We decided to take a look at the dessert menu, which the waiter then brought over a big platter displaying about eight different desserts. My friend and I decided on the Mixed Berry Torta, which was pretty good, not too heavy and not too sweet.
The service was excellent. All the staff members were very friendly, and they all made sure we were good."
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Skeeter H.","This place has only been open for a handful of months but honestly some of the best Italian food we have ever had! The entrees came out fresh and pipping hot and the pasta was clearly home made. The sauce was vesty fresh and tasty and did not at all disappoint. Between my girl friend and I we both thoroughly enjoyed the ravioli and veal dishes and have decided we will add it into our regular rotation for treating us for a meal on the town. We also tried a cannoli and the tiramisu desserts and both are made at the restaurant and both were equally as good. Pricing for food was fair, the wait staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was nice!
Two thumbs us from us on this place!"
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Krista T.","WOW! A must try!
I decided to try Sansonina after several people on the I Love Renton! Facebook page recommended it. I placed a reservation on OpenTable and gave it a whirl.
The owners did a really great job of transforming this location (formerly Pizza Hut) into a very nice restaurant with plenty of space.
Okay, okay - let's get straight to the important stuff... THE FOOD.
APPETIZER & SALAD:
Gamberoni Fiorentini: 5 STARS. (Huge prawns, amazing flavor, must try if you love garlic. YUM)
Caesar Salad: 4 STARS (Not very big for $9, but the dressing is good.)
ENTREES
-Ravioli con Salsiccia
Sautéed bell peppers and red onions, spicy sausage, cilantro red sauce - 5 STARS
-Seafood Cioppino - 5 STARS (LOADED with seafood and had a nice spice to it. He loved it.)
-Ravioli con Salsiccia - 5 STARS (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
A large portion, the cilantro red sauce was very unique and delicious,
the sausage was top-notch...oh and the ravioli! So good.)
DESSERT:
- Key Lime Pie: 4 STARS. Enough to be split between 3 people.
Overall: Sansonina blew me away. Quality, flavorful food within a nice atmosphere and very attentive service. I will be back again!"

My friend treated me to this restaurant for my birthday & I had a great time catching up while enjoying beautifully presented food in a nice atmosphere. To my surprise, Sansaonina took over the old Pizza Hut & converted it to this new restaurant. I grew up around this area & just thought it was cool when my gps took me here because it's now probably one of the nicest restaurant located in this neighborhood besides Melrose Grill.
This is one of those places that you come for a special celebration/occasion because they have an extensive wine list, but this is good if you're simply just craving Italian food on a random Tuesday evening also. The space is small & intimate, easy to get your server's attention. My rule of thumb is just if I can't make out easily what the menu is saying with the fancy language, it's probably legit Italian food. Parking is really easy, plenty of space in the back if the front gets full.

I'm very excited to have a new great Italian restaurant in the area!"

The owner/manager is from Spain and is not only gracious and friendly, but his attention to detail is impeccable! I ate here just the other night with a group of six ladies and he was kind enough to seat us in the private booth, which is usually reserved for special occasions All six of us got different items from fresh sauteed halibut to chicken cacciatore to spaghetti bolognese. Presentation is beyond lovely, fresh toasted bread with garlic butter is addictive and atmosphere is warm and cozy. The only downside is that they're still waiting for their liquor license which hopefully will be coming very soon."

They make all the pasta in-house. Great service and very attentive staff. We started with salads. I had the Cesar which was good. My husband ordered the Greek salad which he said was outstanding with the dressing perfect. For the main course, I had the carbonara which the Waite staff said was grandmas recipe. Very rich and yummy! Husband ordered the ravioli which he says was also exceptional. The desert tray looked amazing but way too full for that. Next time I will remember to save room!"

"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Phoebe K.","If you haven't checked this place out since it changed ownership 6 months ago, I highly recommend you head over and try it soon.
Yes, the Italian food is delicious, the view is great, the wine is awesome, but the warm service and hospitality is what truly shines at Park Place. Really, the service was perfect.
The new owners, Corona and Daniel, understand what it means to be warm and welcoming to guests, including families. When we walked in on a Saturday night, a party of seven (including my 18 month old daughter and my out-of-town parents), they treated us like gold. Just one example of their attentiveness: they noticed that my kid was saying ""hungry"" and we'd run out of snacks, so they rescued us by giving her a mini plate of plain pasta to snack on before the food came out.
The ambiance inside is kind of romantic with white tablecloths, but honestly I'd rather have sat outside for the view. (It was too cold.)
The Caesar salad were really good. I'd definitely get one for lunch if I was in the neighborhood.
I came back today for a coffee and ended up having a nice chat with Corona. He mentioned that they're able to make a lot of the entrees vegan on request, which interested me because I have a relative who is vegan. I know we'll be back because not only is the food great but the people are too."

As we live in the neighborhood, it has become a favorite. They serve good Italian food, nicely spiced. We were there recently and had the Pasta de Casa and the risotto special, which featured fresh chanterelles and prawns. Both dishes were delicious and the serving size perfect. The only issue that I had was related to the spotty service. It was a Saturday evening and they were very busy. They had lots of employees working but, perhaps they were new to restaurant service. We enjoy Park Place and the atmosphere and will return. Hopefully, their service will improve."

"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Melissa R.","We had dinner at Park Place for the first time last night. We had been away all summer and we're looking forward to trying it after talking to the new owners, while walking our dog.
We received a wonderful reception upon arrival and continued to receive perfect service and delicious food. My husband had the veal saltimboca, and I had the pasta bolognese. Both were as good as you can get. Perfectly prepared and perfect portions. We had the tiramisu for dessert which was also just right. Great wines as well. We'll be back. We welcomed the pricing; it's nice to feel as though you haven't been had."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","The food here can be either really good or just okay. The clams with chorizo was a giant portion and had good flavor but the grilled bread served with it was burnt. The arugula salad was bland and needed a bit more dressing. The sausage pasta was good albeit a bit too creamy. The fish of the day, halibut, was very good. I'd give the food a 4-4.5 star range. Portions were large so it negates the semi high price point.
Our biggest gripe was the service. We were seated and immediately given water and the menus. It took us about twenty minutes to be able to put in our food order. When the server finally asked us if we were ready, we had to ask if there were specials (which there were). I requested a drink that they didn't have an ingredient for, which was completely understandable, but then that caused an additional ten minute delay to get our drinks. Service was so slow/off that we decided against a bottle of wine because we saw a neighboring table pouring their own glasses and don't think that's acceptable for a semi-empty restaurant charging the prices they are with the ambiance they are trying to provide. Service improved towards the end but it was an issue to the point where it played into our beverage choice. $200 all in for a two person dinner and you just expect a bit more."

"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Cameron E.","Stunning contrasts - great view and great appetizers, but the service was almost comically bad and the mains were nothing to write home about.
Came here since it's a neighborhood restaurant for us, and we were really excited about the new opening under new ownership. Made an easy reservation with OpenTable and were shown immediately to a table on the front stoop. The host promised ""we'll be by shortly with waters.""
No waters appeared, but after some delay, a server showed up, noting ""oh, I'll be by with some waters in just a sec."" Five minutes later, she comes back to ask if we had menu questions, no waters in hand.
Finally get the waters and appetizers are in. She walked off without even taking a drink order - so I had to flag her down and order a glass of wine. It mean, it was comically bad that she didn't even ask if any one at the table wanted anything to drink, or wanted drinks before appetizers.
When the apps finally showed up, they were pretty good; we had the calamari that was sautéed with capers and olives, and a prosciutto with melon and arugula. While the portions were off in the latter (too much meat, too little melon) it was good, and we thought the squid was done pretty well with good balance of flavors.
After finally enjoying the apps, we were getting hungry for mains. Too bad the server was nowhere to be found... we flagged her down again and finally insisted on putting mains in. I found it offensive that I had to flag her down multiple times in the evening to keep the meal paced properly.
Meanwhile, the busboy came by and cleared everything off the table...almost aggressively. Then he completely failed to reset the table. When mains showed up, we got food before the table had silver, which is just amateur at best... if you serve food, you should be watching and on top of the table and what's on it at all times. This was clueless... and then when we did finally get silver, after asking and staring at our food, no steak knives arrived... and yet some of us had meat that needed to be cut. We had to flag the bus boy down, deal with the major language gap, and finally we got knives.
Mains were okay - a little bland and underseasoned; my veal was overcooked significantly, toughening it up. The folks at the table with pasta were hit or miss. Some were ok, some were more al dente than they should've been, leaving the pasta still crunchy in spots, not toothy.
Overall, probably not going back... food would've been adequate for a return visit, but the appalling lack of service creates an atmosphere that I would happily forgo. There's lots of places here along Madison that do a good job attending to their customers; I'd rather spend money there and get a consistent experience with good service...
Sad... I like Italian, but they just don't seem to have their stuff together in a way the looks rank amateurish at best."

Another disappointment was that they are listed on passports app as accepting passport. However, the waiter informed us they no longer accept passport since December which I thought was odd. Overall it was ok, not great not bad."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Vincent R.","It's okay. It was a little disappointing as far as serving size, i.e. calamari. Mozzarella di bufala was good, but it was served with unripe tomatoes. Pasta (linguine con vongole) was edible, but not worth $21. Chicken saltimbocca was uninspired and not worth $26. The gnocchi was best. Can't recommend this place, head back to Capitol Hill."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Fort D.","Decided to splurge for new year's eve with my bestie. And the best thing about Park Place, for us, was the cozy, traditional Little Italy decor. Warm, yellow light, railroad layout. Judging by the clientele, this is a beloved neighborhood eatery.
Sadly, the food wasn't very good, either in appearance or in taste, especially at 30-40 dollar plates. My bolognese presented as ragu from a jar atop overcooked spaghetti. Was flashing back to my high school cafeteria while eating it. Her catch of the day, swordfish, was heavily salted and its flavors squelched by too many seasonings.
Undaunted, we chose the marscapone amaretto cheesecake for afters. One bite each, and we put up our napkins. There was a chemical taste and poor texture.
To their credit, they comped the desert. The service was great, if you like the whole Sartre-ian waiter-faith thing.
We enjoyed our night, just none of the food. I hope they can tune up their menu a bit."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer B.","If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I rounded up because the ambiance was wonderful and the service was good.
This place has a lot of potential and if I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably give it a second chance, but our first visit was missing some execution on the dishes we ordered.
My boyfriend had the bolognese and it was decent but not very saucy and rich like others we've tried.
I had the prawns and I was really looking forward to them because the description included butternut squash and truffle vinaigrette which are some of my favorite things! Unfortunately the prawns were really charred and over cooked, the butternut squash was hard and undercooked and I tasted zero hint of truffle.
The portion sizes were really generous, but for the price point and white tablecloths ambiance I would've expected more consistency!"

Having recently moved to Seattle, I've had some difficulty finding a local pizzeria that offers quality without having to spend an outrageous amount (seriously, $30 cheese or pepperoni pies?). Tutta Bella is one of the first local options I've found that serves up a tasty pizza AND with a reasonable price.
From the host to our server, the staff was friendly and helpful with suggesting some of their favorites. We were given the option of where to sit (sort of unheard of with a lunch rush), and opted for the counter so we could watch the pizza making. It's pretty fun to see the pizza you just ordered get made in front of you, and to see it cook.
They do offer lunch specials (mini pizza for a few bucks off), but if you're hungry enough I'd just go with the regular or larger option.
The space was relatively packed, but service was prompt with no considerable lags between ordering to getting our food to paying. Perfect if you're popping in for a quick lunch break.
I'll definitely come back again and try some of their other options.
Tips:
-Limited parking
-If you're coming from Westlake Ave, there's a large staircase on the right of Whole Foods that leads up to Tutta Bella (which is at the top to the left)
-Tutta Bella does have a loyalty program, be sure to grab one of the cards with the information to download the app/redeem (if your server hasn't included it with the bill)"

The first time we dined in. Ordered 1 appetizer and 2 pizzas. The appetizer which had meatballs was impressive. Then the pizzas arrive. The dough was so chewy despite the bread being good quality. The execution was terrible and as a result we had an upset stomach the next day. It's possible they used the dough past it's expiration date because it didn't settle well in my stomach.
The second time we ordered pickup. I decided to give this pace another try. It was a mistake.
The second time the pizza was completely soggy. The pasta carbonara was unseasoned and dry. It tasted miserable.
A place like this in South Lake Union does not deserve to exist. And I am confident the reviews here are all astroturfed.
Please avoid this place at all costs. Yes, they have happy hour. But so does a dozen other joints at South Lake Union. I recommend against dining here."

Well our server was attentive and they were not short of staff today.
Food was made and customized just as requested. Delicious and no error. I would highly recommend their seasonal menu. We got the peach dessert today and it was absolutely out of the world good.
Be noted that they have a shared parking lot with other businesses in the same plaza as Whole Foods and they validate parking so it's easy and peasy.

Tuesday night vibes were pleasant, and the place was not too busy or loud. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. He was very helpful when it came to answering our questions while ordering. I split a 13 inch pizza with one other person and was satisfied enough.
The food came out in a very reasonable amount of time and tasted quite good. However, the pizza had some really burnt spots that you'd definitely want to avoid eating. I also felt like the pizza was mostly crust, which has to be my least favorite part of pizza. Some of the menu items are a bit overpriced, especially the garlic knots. Also, the knots could definitely use some marinara sauce for dipping."

It was a little slow, not too many people. The waitresses were nice. I ordered the happy hour cheese pizza, burrata, and the carbonara. The pizza and caprese were good. Those 2 items came out quickly. Their house bread was really unique and tasty. The carbonara came out last and we sat around for 15 or 20 minutes after we finished the pizza and burrata. Unfortunately, it was super bland. I tried to make sure I tossed it with the sauce and added extra cheese to give it a chance, but it just didn't taste good. It tasted like unsalted butter pasta. I ate a few bites and sent it back because I didn't want to just eat empty carbs. After that moment the wait staff wasn't as friendly as they were before. They offered me a comped dessert which was a kind gesture. I won't be coming back and recommend avoiding the carbonara."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - South Lake Union","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-south-lake-union-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Vivian L.","After living in Napoli, Italy for 6 months and developing a taste bud for authentic Italian cuisine and Neapolitan pizzas, I don't usually bother with pizzas back home as they usually are not worth the task. I've been hankering for Neapolitan pizzas for quite some time now and we had just spent all day unpacking into our new home. We decided to treat ourselves for pizza and the only one I'd want is a Neapolitan one that I didn''t have to drive to and there is was, Tutta Bella... 2 minutes walk from our new apartment (Kiara).
Is it good? Why, Yes, why yes it is. At least mine was. It was so good I didn't bother tasting my husband's pizza. But let me start with the starter.
Salad (Ceasar salad with anchovies) - the bite, bursting with flavors. From the lemon zest to the fresh cracked peppercorns to the crunch in romaine lettuces to the sinking of the teeth into the cheese slices to the burnt notes of the crouton toasts... all, perfecto! The anchovies bring it allllll in.
Pizza (The Roberto) - extra virgin olive oil, pistachio purée, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, smoked buffalo mozzarella, basil, egg (per request), finished with pecorino Romano. Did I mention, PISTACHIO PURÉE? Have you tried, pistachio purée? On a pizza? I highly doubt it. Pizzas come with all sort of crazy toppings theses days, pistachio should definitely be one of them! Bc is not a big meat/chicken eater, I get egg on everything. I don't think it would've been as good without the egg. Perfectly cooked and runny. It was goood you should've seen our plates : empty.
Dessert (Gelato)- first timers get a freebie! Hubby and I both got ours complimented. What a nice treat! His was salted caramel, mine the seasonal orange. His was a little salty and mine was refreshing but a little too sweet. We both aren't avid sugar eaters but we both finished our desserts.
Atmosphere : smacking view of the iconic Seattle Space Needle. Romantic views of city lights. Pretty much the cleanest polished looking pizzeria I'd ever been to, surpassing ones in LA and California Pizza Kitchens, yet, chillaxed. Rooftop patios = DOG FRIENDLY :).
Upstairs from Whole Foods.
Opens late.
Service : wonderful. Helpful, attentive, and not overbearing.
Sustainability : Reusables dining in. Cardboard boxes takeout/delivery. Recycles & composts.
Happy hour : Daily (3-6 / 9-close)
Lunch specials : M-F (11-3)

They each got a pizza and I got a salad. I got the napoli salad, it was pretty large! It was definitely one of the better salads I have ever had. The chicken was so nice and crispy. I am used to chicken in salad being just boiled or grilled, not very flavorful. But the chicken in this salad had a nice crust on it. The contents in the salad were also very satisfying. The cheese and ham were my favorite. I also got a lemoncoco on the side, this was alright. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was an interesting flavor. It tasted like a thicker coconut water to me, I was not a fan.
Anyway, the salad was delicious. Definitely try the napoli if you are here."

I am not a pizza fan but a few days ago without any options nearby without a huge wait-list my team and I decided to stop by for lunch.
I picked the clam spaghetti while most of them picked pizzas and one chose the lasagna.
Everything was medicore. Nothing much to have about. The server was pleasant and sweet but took a while to bring stuff around.
We also got two desserts , a tiramisu and a Nutella calzone.
The calzone was like a giant croissant and tasted ok because it was warm. It would not taste great otherwise. The tiramisu was humongous . Despite there people sharing the bowl there was a lot left.
The above mentioned along with some beverages came up to $100 ish.

Service was really quick and our pizza came out hot and cooked to perfection. There was some confusion on if the pizza was half off for happy out and it turns out it wasn't. Spent quite a bit on it. Overall though really good pizza! The crust is thin in the middle but thick on the outside. Make sure you ask for the free gelato if it is your first time there! I got the Nutella flavor and even though I'm in love with Nutella, it wasn't my favorite flavor. I'd try a different flavor."

It is located right above the Whole Foods. Mid-size restaurant. Went on a non-Friday weeknight and they were doing decent business, but we didn't have to wait for a table.
As their name indicates, their specialty is the Neapolitan Pizza. They also have salads, pastas, and gelato for dessert. I got the personal size (10 inch) prosciutto and arugula pizza. They put plenty of arugula on the pizza. The pizza tasted quite good, as the saltiness of the prosciutto blends well with the cheesy aroma of the pizza and the fresh arugula. A 10 inch pizza was the perfect portion for me. If you go during happy hour (4-6, and 9 to close), you get a small discount on the pizzas and cocktails."

I had the meatball pizza with Ricotta cheese. It tastes great, but was messy and wound up not settling well with me either. The service was ok. The individual that was our server took a very long time to get our drinks and to get the check correct. It was somewhat embarrassing.
The vibe was very casual and very hip. I really liked the vibe. Please be aware it is noisy in here so if you want to have a more private conversation, avoid going here as you will have to speak up or seem like your yelling at times.

"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - South Lake Union","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-south-lake-union-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","James R.","Going to Tutta Bella's in Westlake was an experience that was different compared to Columbia City. Overall the place was spacious with an attentive wait staff and a relaxed atmosphere. I had the Roberto pizza and it was very nice, the buffalo cheese adds a little smokey flavor which was very refreshing on the palate. Of course I splurged and got the Tutta Bella Amber Ale (handcrafted by them). The gelato which I got the orange flavor, adds a nice citrus flavor, and tastes just like creamsicle! The espresso being strong adds a nice bitter taste which limits the sweetness of the gelato. Lastly with the view of the Space Needle right outside the window, this place is truly remarkable in presentation and overall aesthetics; both food and atmosphere wise. I will most definitely be returning here again in the near future."

The cheese in the buffala starter was nice and creamy and spread easily on the fresh crostini. The pizza with the pistachio was fantastic, like a cross between peanut butter and pesto with actual cashews on the pizza. Fun play on the pizza. I tried some of the traditional pizzas and they were also very fresh with quality cheese.
Overall really liked this place and will be back before long."

"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Gabriel E.","I'd like to preface this review by letting the people know I'm totally happy eating a burrito at home every night, but the misses won't let me.
I went here once when I was broke. My expensive ass girlfriend insisted we go!! Good lord that price tag had me shaking in my boots. BUT!! Holy smokes the experience was crazy!! That crazy ass spaghet with the black little fish eggs on top!? What is that stuff?!?! The grilled octopus with hominy grits?!?! My lord it is fiirrreeee. Now I have more scratch so it's not as terrifying to go, but I will say my credit score has taken a dip since truly committing to this chick. The service is literally the best thing that ever happened. It's like being at your friends house who is your favorite friend and is the best host out of all your friends, but then they charge you $500 on the way out. I'm going here tonight and I can't flipping dipping wait!! Ohhhhh I bet the bottle we get is gonna sting lol. Oh!?!?! The architecture and decor is a dream. The exterior is very unassuming but once you're inside it looks like somewhere Don Draper would take his side chick. 10/10 would recommend."

They have wonderful staff and wonderful dishes with lovely presentation! I always want to applause the chefs as we leave and sometimes I do!!
Lately our favorites are:
1) Hearth bread 3 piece appetizer with 3 toppings (avocado w lime, hummus w garbanzo and pesto, and dElicious mushrooms)
2) Crab with granny apple sorbet in a dried butter crab ""dust"". It's like dipping wArm crab into warm butter but it's cold crab in cold crab flavored butter ""dust. We LOVE this!!! So unique!!
3) If they have the scallops we hhave go get them and I won't get them anywhere else ever! They are cooked to perfection and last night came with a puréed parsnip, cippolinni onions, special blood orange segments, and o think arugula. Outstanding!!!!
4) their bread service is outstanding and they have wonderful items and a great variety for anyone.
5) my fave pasta right now is the tagliatelle with mushrooms and parmesan - the best anywhere!!
6) desserts are spectacular but our three faves are the chocolate sorbet which is super creamy like ice cream, the amazing panna cotta which has a honey from Spain below it, and the oil cake which is more like angel cake and currently served with a lemon sorbet and a pistachio ""cracker candy"" and pansies. Each is wonderful in its own rIght.
Just go! Treat yourself but save us a table!!!!

"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","C Hayley H.","Talk about an incredible dining experience! Cafe Juanita absolutely blew me away with the fabulous services and outstanding food. This is definitely a special occasion type of restaurant and a bit spendy, but well worth the price. I opted for the chef's tasting menu, which was $145/person. It was an additional $85/person with the wine pairing. In addition to the six courses, there was a bonus mini cocktail and appetizer at the beginning that were both delightful and full of flavor. I think what surprised me the most was the Alaskan King crab appetizer served with green apple sorbetto and crab butter powder. The combination of flavors was light and worked very well together.
The wine pairings and dishes came out at a good pace, so it was a little over a two-hour meal. Each wine paired very well with the dish served. I was also really impressed with the Tajarin with white sturgeon caviar (paired with Dom Perignon) dish. Even the variety of breads that were brough to the table before the meal were delicious and well crafted.
I love Cafe Juanita and can't wait to return!"
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica N.","Nice little fine dining gem tucked away in the Juanita neighborhood. We did the prefix menu and every course was exquisite. The crab dish was incredible - nice big fresh piece. It was served over a sorbet. An interesting blend of flavors but have to admit, cld have done without the sorbet part. the other winning course was the angel hair pasta with caviar on top. So buttery and delicious! Main course was the lamb... good but nothing incredibly memorable. Service was excellent, they even brought us some celebratory champagne to end off meal! All in all a great dining experience!"
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","P J.","Had a birthday dinner here. The food was very good and rich. Had some great dishes.
My favorite dish was the Pasta Special. That night, the special was a Parpadelle with Alaskan Prawns. It was delicious with a great chew on the pasta. I hope to be back when that is the pasta special again.
The Pork Cheeks were tender and rich. The rabbit had great flavor. The birthday Affogato was very good. My husband really loved the Bayleef Gelato. It was really unique and fun.
Then thing that made the restaurant memorable was the service. It was really impeccable. It was as if the staff was trained at a Ritz Carlton hotel. Will definitely be back."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff D.","This is a well-oiled machine of a restaurant. Effortless valet, pleasant greeter, quietly effective servers and an interior that promotes repast. It is clear why this place carries the reputation it does.
I enjoyed my octopus appetizer. When the waiter stated it was the most tender he'd ever had, I was skeptical. After a bit, without the familiar spring, I didn't know if I liked it. As I mixed it with the verde and hummus it certainly won me over. Similarly, I was skeptical of the quince on the Iberico Pork Cheeks. I was worried about too much sweetness. After the first bite I judiciously rationed out the fruit so a small piece accompanied every bite of the rich and tender meat. Can Panna Cotta be too smooth. I was promised one of the smoothest varieties available and again, the waiter was right. Rich and creamy with a tad of salt and pepper (?) mad it a joy.
I'm many spots, a meal this good comes with effort, by my kitchen-view seat afforded me a look at a quiet and efficient workspace. Relax, you're at Cafe Juanita. Breath."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Klarke C.","A must visit if you're looking for a phenomenal tasting menu. We visited on a Friday night around 8pm and were pleasantly surprised at how good everything was.
The location is off of a side road and at night, you could blink and miss it. But don't let that fool you, the interior is beautiful and cozy.
If it's your first time here, I strongly recommend the Chefs Tasting Menu and add on the grilled octopus!
And if you're in the mood grab a bottle of wine. We ordered a Barbera that we absolutely enjoyed.
On top of great food, the service staff were friendly and we talked with our server not just about the menu but about other spots we love to eat at in the Seattle area!
Can't wait to revisit Cafe Juanita soon to try some of their other dishes with the dinner service"
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Eugenia L.","I try to find any excuse to book a table at Cafe Juanita. It's low key fine dining. The dress code isn't too strict, but the service and food are phenomenal.
While their menu changes, there are a few mainstays like the foie gras and rabbit. But they do tweak it based on what's seasonable & available. For this particular visit my favorite dishes were the fish of the day (black cod) and the foie gras. They both featured fall/winter ingredients and warm spices. It captured that the essence of sweater weather season without tasting like PSL.
Lastly a huge kudos to the staff. Services was attentive, knowledgeable but not overbearing. You don't feel like they're breathing over your shoulder or judging your wine choices."

There were 4 of us and we constantly in awe of our food, the presentation, even the dishes used to serve. This is a restaurant that takes perfection, ambiance, and presentation to an entirely new level. A must visit if you love all things wonderful.
The foie gras was seared to perfection. My pasta with caviar was heavenly. Everyone at the table was quiet for a few minutes after each course because we were savoring the entire experience. Even dessert!
Joshua was a lot of fun - he was attentive, knowledgeable, playful with one of our out of country guests...and we were grateful he was there to make our experience wonderful.
Hats off the women in the kitchen and behind the counters cooking. We loved the open kitchen and being able to watch the intensity and passion - and hats off to Holly Smith for sharing her culinary talent with all of us.

Words won't do Cafe Juanita proper justice- Cafe Juanita is a remarkable Restaurant from its service, food, drinks and ambience.
We made our own shareable Family-style tasting menu and would encourage others to do the same to get a 360 experience- our dearest Friends were treating us out but we also all used this as a Seattle fine-dining scouting trip as well.
Rest assured that we have now officially found our Go-To Fine Dining Restaurant on the East Side- Cafe Juanita would hold its own with the best Michelin-rated restaurants that we would always frequent in NYC Manhattan."

Appreciate it."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Kathy H.","This might be my favorite restaurant in the Seattle area. The restaurant is tucked away in a quiet kirkland neighborhood. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the decor. The restaurant has minimalist decor with a homey vibe. We were greeted and seated almost immediately.
To start off the meal, we tried an apertivi (the somerset) which consisted of a delicious cocktail and a small amuse bouche. The menu changes often, but I understand they offer different apertivis every month.
We also decided to share a few dishes: the brussel sprouts, the butter lettuce salad, the tajarin with sage butter, the rabbit, and bombolini. Everything tasted amazing. All the dishes had so much flavor, and every dish was thoughtfully put together. I don't think I've ever been so impressed with a salad before! The plating and the flavors worked so well together. Also, your meal comes with a side of bread, and the bread plate was delicious!
One thing I appreciated the most about my experience was the staff. They were attentive and ensured that our anniversary celebration felt special. During out dinner, they were never overbearing, and seemed to time our dinner perfectly.
It was an amazing experience, and we would definitely consider coming back to cafe Juanita for another special occasion.
One thing to note: the parking lot is very small, so expect valet only. They allow you to take care of the valet cost with your dining bill, so it makes your experience very smooth."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Matt H.","I have really enjoyed my dinner at Cafe Juanita the couple of times I have eaten here. It is some of the best food I have had in the larger Seattle area, and I think it's awesome that there is such a nice dining option hidden in the small downtown Juanita area.
The interior of Cafe Juanita is classily decorated, and the entire edge of the restaurant has continuous windows that somehow give a great view even though the restaurant is tucked between condo complexes. The wait staff is attentive and nice, but not overly stuffy. The atmosphere is relaxed for an enjoyable dinner rather than restrictive as some icier restaurants can be.
I've tried several small plates and main dishes. I enjoyed them all, even the ones I wasn't excited for but someone else at the table ordered.
I'm sure I'll be back again. I love having such a nice dining option right around the corner!"

I don't even know how I should review this place cuz everything was great! Service was amazing. Food was exquisite. Wine pairing was the cherry on top! Foie gras was perfectly cooked and seasoned, that sage butter pasta is out of this world, finishing the meal with the tender duck breast is the way to go. You can't go wrong with this place and reservation is recommended. Call them if you can't find an opening using open table. Enjoy and have fun! Definitely will be back to try other items on their menu."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Smrithi S.","We have been wanting to try this place for sometime now, and finally decided to try it recently. We called for a reservation on for dinner an hour before we went and to our surprise we got a reservation.
They had a tasting menu, and an a la carte menu and we decided to go with the a la carte menu. I got a Sorelle Bronca extra brut Prosecco, that comes with 30 month aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, and we got Tajarin sage butter and Ravioli della sera.
Parmigiano-Reggiano paired with Prosecco was a great combo, and a good start to the meal. The Tajarin sage butter was delicious, but the ravioli was the highlight of this course and our meal. It was a beetroot and cheese ravioli, shaped like candies that looked like works of art. They looked so good and tasted much better.
For our next course, we got Guinea fowl and Anderson Valley lamb rack 'Scottadita'. We liked both of our dishes, enjoyed it a lot.
We finished our meal with panna cotta and chocolate gelato. The panna cotta was delicious, loved addition of honey on top of it.
Great place for a date night or a celebration."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Sum H.","What a nice place! Heard they remodeled and the inside looks modern and sleek. Very dark and romantic setting, but here I am with my friend from college. We are foodies. We adventured around all over Washington together.
This place was my friends choice tonight. She was amazed with the food at the first time with her husband and has been eating to try out again.
The all valley parking was a surprise.$8 guess reasonable considering this is $$$$ restaurant. The server was extremely knowledgeable and nice, focused on serving one table at a time. No rush and go type of service. She answered all our questions with lots of details. When I first looked at the menu, I could not imagine what kind of dish each would be. Lots of ??? What's tajarin? Fowl? Escarole??? Well you have an expert to ask, she gives you suggestions and nicely help you out without intimidating you.
We ordered citrus salad, octopus and crab appetizer, sage butter tajarin, white sauce tajarin with caviar, squid ink pasta with prawns, rissotto, veal and gelato.And yes it was too much! But my friend has an experience here that the dishes are quite small. We were hungry so we ordered to comfort our tummy. Ended up taking some veal meat back home.
The dishes are excellent! Everything has exquisite details, the presentation was pretty, the sauces were just right in flavor. I can't tell what they use for the sauces, they are mixture of things I can't create, which is what I look for when eating out cause who wants to eat something you can cook at home? Our favorites have to be the risotto and the squid ink pasta. They are heavenly. If I have a chance to go back, those are the 2 I'd order again. Earl gray gelato was excellent too. I used to like molly moons earl gray ice cream which the flavor going downhill nowadays. CF's gelato I feel is a lighter version of that.
The price probably is the only one I'd deduct the star from. It could have been less? I mean 5 oz Miyazaki steak is $120. The veal we had was $75 though it was a pretty good portion. I'd come a lot more often if the price is better."
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Karina D.","EDIT: Holly Smith (chef-owner) read my review and reached out to me. She was very nice and apologetic. She offered to give us a gift card so that we can try her restaurant again and we took her up on her offer. I will update my review once we give it another try.
I gave it 3 stars because even though the food and service was great, it was not a perfect night for the amount we paid to dine there.
- I reserved 3 weeks ago for last night (Tuesday 10/29). It was both my son and my birthday so we decided to combine both celebrations and dine here. I have been waiting 12 years to convince myself to pay this much money for dinner. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table. They knew it was a special occasion. - they even called to confirm that day. I was disappointi
- The place was packed for a Tuesday night. We waited another 25 minutes before the server greeted us. The water boy came refill our water 3 times before we could meet our server. We were starving - no bread nothing. The menu is hard to navigate. It is using a lot of Italian terminology so we had to Google the content of the menu because the server took so long to come and explain. I don't think it was the servers fault - it just felt they were too busy and maybe understaffed?!
- The food was very very good. Not quite my profile but I still enjoyed it very much. If Northern Italian fares are your thing, this restaurant should be on your bucket list.
Overall, for the price ($500+ for 2 adults and 2 teen) and paying $8 for valet, it felt too busy. They are a victim of their own success probably. They need to revisit their strategy for when guests get seated. Either have the sommelier explain the menu if server is too busy. I just think that 45 min after your reservation time to be able to talk to the server is not acceptable. Taking this one off my bucket list now :)"

Many vegetarian options which I appreciate and the desserts are always delicious. I've never gone wrong whether doing the tasting menu or selecting off the menu. The new section of the restaurant is a little loud but still has the great feeling of being in a house. Overall a great place for a special night out!"
"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Rory J.","3 kids at home, momma needs a girls night out! This was a great choice, upscale, beautiful dining room, great ambience and service.
I started out the prosseco and parm aperitif and, not surprisingly, it was the best .5 inch of Parmesan I'd ever had. Followed that with the octopus appetizer, which I really wanted to live, especially with smoked bone marrow, but it was served on a kind of pesto that too bright and herby and totally overwhelmed every other component of the dish.
For dinner I had the salmon special, I'm in the effing PNW, home of salmon, if it's on the menu, I'm getting it. No shock, it was amazing. The crispy skin was perfect with almost buttery salmon that melted in my mouth. I also love what is was served wit; fresh snap peas, pea flowers, red potatoes and a kind of mash underneath that tied everything together.
It's my new death row dish."
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tasha J.","I'm loving the new West Seattle location! This was a great spot to meet with girlfriends. They have a nice wine selection by the glass and bottle. On this visit we sat at a high top table between the bar and the dining room seating. This was a nice location and we felt like we were in a good place to laugh and be loud without bothering anyone.
We ordered the Saffron Chicken and Burratta as appetizers and the sauce on the chicken was so good that I was putting it on the crustini from the cheese! Absolutely great flavor. Both appetizers were a good size for sharing but def left you wanting more.
We ordered two pizzas to go along with our two bottles of wine as well. The Fig and Pancetta Pizza was awesome. I love how the crust is both crispy and chewy and the flavors meshed together well. I was super full by the time the Prosciutto de Parma Pizza came out but I was told this was fantastic as well!
Enjoy having another awesome place to hit in West Seattle!"
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dianna N.","Prosciutto de Parma Pizza $19: I got hit with a craving for prosciutto pizza on my way home from work, so decided to try this place for takeout. My pizza took about 15 minutes. I measured it when when I got home and it's not a perfect circle, but it was about 10 inches in diameter. My appetite is generally on the smaller side, but I was full after eating this on my own. It wasn't the best prosciutto pizza I've had (that is still Archive Bar & Kitchen in San Francisco) but it was good enough and hit the spot. I didn't taste the olive oil on it, so at home I did dip the crust in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
I do want to come try to dine in sometime to try other items and their yummy looking cocktails!
Update: I have since returned to dine in for a date night and had a great time!
The Phoenician $14: Really likes this drink, it had the right amount of tartness. It went down so easy I could have drank it in one gulp but forced myself to make it last throughout dinner.
Nightshade $13: I normally don't like the drinks my boyfriend orders because the alcohol is too strong for me, but I didn't mind this one! Still not something I would order for myself, but it was pretty smooth.
Burrata $17: A tasty appetizer. The grilled bread was so good! Buttery and the perfect texture to enjoy with the cheese.
Lamb Chop Lollipops $16: The first bite was good and I could taste that garlic-y butter. After that, I either got used to the flavor or it faded because it was a little bit on the bland side. Texture was good, but I personally felt it was missing a tiny pinch of salt.
The Alki $19: The crust was good like last time. Crispy but not burnt. The right amount of chewiness. I did request oil and balsamic vinegar at the restaurant to dip the crust. Flavor wise I would pick the Prosciutto de Parma over this one. I do eventually want to try their pepperoni and Margherita pizza as well.
Tiramisu Cocktail $13: It reminded me of a White Russian, and I love those!
Nutella Cheesecake $9: I'm normally not into chocolate cheesecakes or cakes because I find them too rich. I was willing to give this a try because Nutella and it was tasty! The cheesecake was dense but not overwhelmingly sweet. I didn't really taste any hint of biscotti liquor in the whipped cream though.
Turkish Affogato $8: The coffee comes on the side so you can pour it over yourself. We accidentally put too much coffee on it so the ice cream melted pretty quickly. There was still enough coffee leftover after that to drink some on its own, so it's almost a 2 for 1 deal.

My Star Ratings:
1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.
2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.
3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.
4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.
5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here."
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ethan G.","Came to Phoenecia on a Friday night to grab some dinner and check it out. It maintains a similar vibe to the previous bar which was in the location before, Alchemy. It's ambiance is dimly lit, suave, and perfect for a date night. The service is great and everyone was extremely warm and welcoming, and the cocktails were tasty.
On the food front (the whole reason we came), was where I was disappointed. Simply put - the food is overpriced for what it is. The trio of dips was alright, and the labneh was the standout from a pretty standard lineup. The garlic green beans were the most surprising example of how overpriced I believe the food to be here. The pizza was good, although not memorable compared to other slices you can get even a few blocks down in West Seattle.
Overall, I'd come here again if I was just getting a cocktail - but I wouldn't come back for dinner."
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dhanashree A.","They are back! I am so glad they reopened. I was really sad when they closed so yay! We went here to celebrate our engagement anniversary.
It remains one of my favorite places in Seattle. The new location is very cozy. I really liked the decor. I thought the tables might be more spaced out but it's a minor thing. The service is wonderful as always. Our server was witty and attentive. He was also super generous with the wine. We got to try some options before we chose what we wanted. He made our evening really enjoyable.
Their scallops are the best I have ever tried. I love everything about them. The sear is perfect, the cook is awesome and the flavor is mind blowing! We also got their saffron chicken and margarita pizza. I really enjoyed both. The pizza has fresh tomatoes which are wonderful to eat.
We'll keep coming back. I have always celebrated special occasions here and this place is close to my heart!"
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Grace C.","Favorite date spot that I've been to. We ordered the fig salad, pizza and the lamb shank.
The fig salad may look small but it is not to be messed with. Super flavorful and we demolished it in seconds. The figs were juicy and went so well with the arugula.
The pizza was also pretty good- you can't mess up pizza. But really the star of the show was the lamb shank. With a hefty price tag- I cannot emphasize how great this dish was. Our waiter told us that the lamb shank is the only thing the original owner still makes and man is it good. The meat just falls off the bone. It's so flavorful and juicy and overall drool worthy.
The cocktails were really good as well! Very refreshing. The waiters have a good idea of what to recommend to you so I wold go with that.
Overall- GO HERE!! you will not regret it. 10/10 be back again."

"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jorge D.","After waiting for a new location to open and since they had great reviews at their old location, my wife was eagerly waiting. Living in the Junction and being a block away, we really wanted to like it. Unfortunately we were both very disappointed.
The menu is definitely limited, we ordered the small plates and a Pizza.
I think if you are a Lebanese restaurant the hummus plate should be free or less expensive they served 6 small slices of Pita with 3 little dips $13.00 then ordered the lamb chops one bite for each with no flavor.They do not have a happy hour so the average drinks are $14.00 and small, Beer is a 12oz glass not even a pint as mostly all restaurants in Junction serve, Entrees are all $$$$ no choices and small portions.
So we ordered a Pizza and compared to other places in the junction the pizza has a lot to be desired.
We asked the server for a box for 3 slices of pizza and the bill and we were in shocked when he returned with a black (doggie) bag and the pizza wrapped in foil paper, for the amount they charged on the Entrees and the fine dinning they advertised they can afford a simple box for customer to take their leftovers.It looked like a dog Poop bag!!!.
We will not be returning is a shame because we are locals and we were hoping this restaurant would have been a success."

We had wine, appetizers eventually a pizza and everything was delicious!
The service was also fantastic! Our server was Jeffrey and he was helpful, fun, and provided the perfect amount of attention - I'd hope to have him as my server again. We finished the night off with the Turkish affagato which was incredible. Finally, love the atmosphere - a little dark and moody - the perfect amount for a fun or romantic night."

What a gem in the heart of west Seattle. It's located at the old alchemy. When you walk in you are immediately greeted by a group of very friendly staff member, this was the first time I came here and I immediately felt like I was a regular. The food was all amazing, we started with the fiery scallops and burrata- both were amazing. I am typically skeptical about pizza at small plates restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised. The crust was baked with a crispy exterior and a nice warm fluffy interior and the toppings were all cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with a light and fragrant Turkish affogato and my girlfriend had super crispy and fluffy baklava served with rose ice cream.
I will definitely be returning here again very soon. Without a doubt this restaurant has earn a spot in my heart as one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Washington State."
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael A.","Absolutely love this restaurant. When I moved from VA to Seattle couple of years back, I was looking for a local place that can offer friendly and professional staff with really homemade delicious food. I became a fan once I tried their food and pizza. Nadia always made me feel at home with her beautiful smile and wonderful service. Few months ago we went to the old address across from Alki beach and it was closed. I was so disappointed. I'm happy to say they Re-opened the brand new restaurant at new address 4717 42nd Avenue SW, west Seattle. I am going to try the new location very soon I have heard it's going strong with even better selection-cannot wait! This became a place of distinct flavors, experiences and memories for me since I have been here in Seattle.
The best part about the experience, in addition to the fresh and deliciously prepared food, is the family that owns the restaurant. They have a special gift and make you feel like you are part of their family. This is what makes Phoenicia truly extraordinary and like no other place in the junction or West Seattle.
I had the safron chicken and artesian pizza's, such as butternut squash; fiery lamb and chèvre; and my favorite truffle oil and mushrooms. Also try their handcrafted cocktails. You won't be disappointed."

"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tammy Y.","Note to those wanting to try S&F, you'll want to make a reservation! I had been looking at reservations for this spot for weeks and finally found an early 5:45pm availability on a weekend evening and seized the opportunity! My friend and I got our nails done and then high-tailed it over for a pleasing tasting menu dinner. I loved that they took all of our food allergy needs into account and were able to customize each of the courses brought out to us throughout the evening. I was also excited that they incorporated several greens and fresh produce into the small plates they brought out to us. It was also great to see they offer half pours of their glasses of wine, in case you want to try a few different options.
Having had the tasting menu I don't think I could ever have a meal here any other way. I loved being surprised by what plate came next and the way the chefs mixed flavors and textures throughout the meal. I'm a pescatarian and my friend cannot have shellfish, so where she had beef, I had beets or scallops, and where I had a fried oyster, she was presented with a fried cauliflower. The substitutions made sense and neither person was ever disappointed with the substitution they received. The squid ink pasta was exactly what I had wanted to try so I was thrilled it was part of our tasting menu. Our server let us know if there is ever anything we know we want to taste we can let them know and they will be sure to put it into the tasting menu - now that is great service!
From start to finish Staple and Fancy brought their A game. We were seated right away, not ever rushed, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal, especially the finishing touch of the hazelnut chocolate dessert. I look forward to coming back and seeing what else is on the tasting menu - can't wait!"
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Emma H.","Nice atmosphere and service but not 100% sold that the chefs menu was worth the price.
Everything was yummy but nothing wow and it was a little disappointing that we had hardly any meat in our tasting menu despite saying it was a preference.
Also took a long time between pasta dish and entree...they were busy so I actually think they might have run out of what was going to be our entree.
The cocktails were some of the best I've had!
Definitely a cute date spot and novel approach but if you know what you like there are restaurants where you get more for the price you pay."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Clint W.","I came for a business meeting and we did the fancy feast and it was a blast. Tons of food and the entrees were really good.
The table was spread with a salad, fried oysters, Hamachi, squash soup, some charcuterie, and a pate on crostini. There was a good sized primi of a pasta in red sauce with guanciale. Really tasty with just a touch of bite.
Entrees were duck breast with Jerusalem artichokes and scallops for a bed of cannelli beans in a tomato sauce. Big fan of those beans.
Tons of food and I think made me realize how much I like Staple."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Austin H.","My girlfriend and I went here during Seattle Restaurant Week and while we throughly enjoyed our dining experience neither of us thought it was near the level of How to Cook a Wolf. Obviously that is a very high level to achieve but I still expected everything to be excellent and some dishes were just okay.
One awesome part was that we got to try every appetizer they had for the Restaurant Week. The acorn squash soup and salad were both solid. The fried oysters with aioli tasted delicious and the beef tartare was sensational and easily my favorite of the small starter plates. My gf loved the porchetta the most.
For the mains I got the hangar steak and my gf got the gnocchi. I would 100% get the hangar steak again as it was cooked perfectly and it had great flavor with its sauce and accompaniments. The gnocchi however we both agreed wasn't great. It was way too orange forward and it was easily the worst thing we ate the whole night. We were both shocked by this as we thought the pasta was going to be amazing.
We were each feeling kind of full after all that we had but Seattle Restaurant Week is such a good deal that for $35 a piece dessert was included for each of us! I got the lemon ricotta cheesecake and my gf got the amaretto cake. Both were very good and a nice way to close out.
All in all I really enjoyed my dining experience here and getting to try all that we did for $35 but I can't see myself coming here and paying full price when I know I can get amazing pasta at a similar price point elsewhere."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dominic D.","My partner and I have had this place on our list for some time. We visited during Seattle Restaurant Week and did their tasting menu. Overall we enjoyed most of the dishes, and would recommend visiting (especially during their 5-6 HH with great value). Again, this is part of the Ethan Stowell empire, so you'll get consistent quality and service, but admittedly not the most creativity. A solid 4/5.
Food: All appetizers were included, and we also got some Sea Wolf baguette on the side (always to drool for). Appetizers were the let down for me, especially the acorn squash soup. The beef tartare was extremely well done though, and my partner liked the fried oysters (admittedly I didn't). Mains were potato gnocchi and hanger steak. Stowell always nails his gnocchi! Hanger steak was well balanced and overall filling. Dessert was Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake (recommend) and Amaretto Cake (hard Pass. Literally was over baked and dried out).
Drinks: We shared two cocktails and found them average. Nothing exciting for the price, but the half glasses of wine are of decent value.
Atmosphere: Social, quaint and lovely. A great romantic date night, with lots of places to start or end around."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sharvari A.","I love love love staple and fancy! The fried oysters here are to die for. Everything else on the menu is great too.
The first time I came to staple and fancy was during Seattle restaurant week and I'm so glad I did. They had 5 appetizers- to share and then main course and dessert. The food was EXCELLENT and service was great too. Since then it has been my go to place for a date night or celebrations and the food has always been amazing!
The wait mostly isn't long but it can get pretty busy on the weekends. There isn't much to do around, since it's on the less busy east end of Ballard ave. But on the plus side, it's easy to find parking. I recommend making a reservation to save time.
If you haven't been here yet, I HIGHLY recommend it. One of my most fav restaurants in Seattle!!!"
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex W.","I came here on a Friday evening after seeing pictures of the pasta all over Instagram. I started off with the Roasted Beets appetizer. For the price, I was pleasantly surprised with how much was on the plate. Definitely a fair portion for two, but if you're sharing with any more, I'd suggest ordering another. At the time I went (a few weeks back), the beets came with arugula, figs, and a sort-of mayo sauce. This dish wasn't as flavorful as I would've hoped, as the sauce didn't provide much and the cheese didn't add enough saltiness. The only true bites of flavor were if you ate it with the fig and even then it was a pretty subdued flavor.
For pasta, I tried the Pappardelle. The bowl they serve it in looks quite small at first, but this is actually quite the hefty portion. The sauce is rich and the noodles are thick so this is a substantial meal for one or would even be good to split. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed by this dish. It was unbelievably greasy and so wildly salty that I couldn't taste anything but grease and salt. It was a pork and beef blend in the sauce so I was hoping to taste a bit more flavor. There was so much grease in the sauce that it was pooling in the dish-- never an appetizing sight. The pasta was cooked well & the addition of the ricotta was much needed, but I was largely disappointed in the one-note flavor of this dish. Overall, I was expecting a bit more from Staple & Fancy. I was hoping for a more nuanced flavor in both things I tried, and left feeling a bit unwell after ingesting one of the greasiest pastas I've ever tried."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Karen F.","Our 2nd visit to S&F and we will absolutely be returning customers. We had a perfect dinner here last night. Walked in late on Monday night 9:30 pm. Ballard is very sleepy at that time and we were worried we would be turned away but the server was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to seat us. She helped us select a nice bottle of wine for our romantic meal. Motown music was playing and great lighting set the mood. The cocktails we ordered were well prepared and I watched the bartender prepare them with care. Zero attitude in this place.
For food we shared Fois gras with seasonal grilled fruits, Pappardelle with a bolognese sauce and risotto with lobster mushrooms and uni butter. All of these dishes were perfect for the dark, cold evening. Rich, comforting and balanced. In summary, the room, the ambiance, the service, wine and the food were just perfect. Restaurants like this are the reason we keep driving all the way from Vancouver, Canada to visit your town. Can't wait to return!"
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Megan W.","The boyfriend and I came here for our fancier meal during our visit to Seattle and were very excited to try the pasta power hour! $35 for a three course meal sounded too good to be true. It included 5 appetizers, a pasta entree, and a dessert.
The appetizers were probably the better part of the meal, our favorites including the chicken liver pate on toast and the fried oysters with aioli. For our pastas we got the pappardelle and ravioli and felt they were both very average. The pastas had good flavor but a little too much acid, making them rather underwhelming. Dessert was a hit and a miss, the pumpkin cheesecake was velvety and wonderful whereas the peach upside down cake was dry and dense.
The service was lovely as our waitress was very attentive and all of the staff was friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was cozy and warm, especially inviting on a rainy night. Overall I'd say it's a nice place for date night but nothing special enough to splurge over."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Matt S.","Although we had reservations, we were sat at the bar. The three of us in our party had the tasting menu.
The courses that came out were all pretty breath-taking and i would recommend as a highlight for anyone looking for a spectacular meal.
What impressed me the most was the kitchens enthusiasm and willingness to send out multiple items and custom items not on the tasting menu which aligned with our preferences (i'm not an organ meat fan) so they worked around me but showered my friends with pate.
I really can't wait to go back and be treated to another amazing meal!"

When we arrived they had charcuterie boards set out - absolutely delicious and high quality.
When we sat down we had an array of appetizers - the fried oysters, chicken liver pate, homemade mozzarella, Hamachi Crudo, and gem lettuce salad. The Hamachi was my favorite!! Incredible!
Second course, we had the crab risotto and and the bolognese. They both were awesome, I don't think I can choose which I preferred.
We had the striploin from their wood fire grilled which was delicious with potatoes and asparagus! I loved the asparagus, the meat was also delicious.
Dessert was gelato and cheesecake - both exceptional.
It is pricey, but worth it!

"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Molly M.","So. Let me start by saying my boyfriend and I keep recommending this place to people who visit Seattle and referencing the meal we had here as one of the best meals of our lives. The tasting menu is a must (and a really good deal for all the food you get!). We went for a late birthday dinner for me and the host and waitress made sure to make the night special by having a complementary glass of champagne, a card, and in general just asking about my birthday plans. The waitress and host were interested in our trip to Seattle (we were visiting from Atlanta) but not annoyingly so. It was a great atmosphere where we felt welcomed but not intruded upon. Now to the food - there are no words. We enjoyed each of the 10 plates at a 5/5 level, which is a rarity. Everything tasted fresh yet had a lot of flavor and was unique. We felt absolutely stuffed afterwards but not gross. I think our favorite dish was the pasta with octopus, chorizo, red sauce, and black noodles. It sounds like kinda a weird combo but the combo and whatever red sauce was in the pasta was AMAZING. You should definitely just let them take the reigns on the tasting menu - they know what they're doing! They also give you the option to tell them anything you don't like before committing to the tasting menu. We will definitely be back here during our next visit to Seattle!"
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wendy K.","I've been to Staple and Fancy for fancy before I started writing reviews regularly. Had a chance to go during Restaurant Week earlier this week. Had friends visiting from out of town who love good food and don't like chains, there were five in our party. I gave them about three suggestions and they selected here. Worked out perfectly it's close to home and had been way to long since I had dined here.
They do things a little different here. The appetizer course of the RWS menu is served family style, so instead on just one item to select from they bring you a number of items. I think our favorite was probably the fried oyster with Calabrian chili aioli. There was also a little espresso cup of potato and caramelized onion soup for each of us, house mozzarella served with romesco, almonds and arugula, been tartare and baby gem salad.
I selected the grilled swordfish as my entrée, the others ordered at our table were the Strozzapreti and Pappardelle. Fish was cooked perfectly and just the right portion it came with corona beans, salsa verde, orange and frisee the acid and freshness made it a wonderfully balanced dish. My friends were leaving the following morning so I was able to take their leftover stropzzapreti and pappardelle home. Both pasta dishes were delicious and that was the day after.
Think three of us had the Pear Chiboust and two had the Fudge Cake for dessert. We also added the red wine special for $35 for table. Service was excellent the staff is well informed not only about the food but the wine as well. You can tell they personally have sampled the wine and dishes by the way they explain things. I've always loved the space, warm and inviting. Also appreciate that they have it on the menu but also are very clear to inform you that the gratuity is included in the price. Hopefully I won't wait so long to go back again."

We came in here for the first time after a day of manual labor (we cleaned up first), looking to have a filling, delicious meal after an exhausting day. We clearly misjudged that Staple and Fancy was the right place to do that.
The host barely looked at us. The server was snide, clearly annoyed that we were under dressed, young, and only ordered mains. We spent $70 on pasta that was good, but not worth the side of snark.
I have never felt so judged by a place I am paying money to be, by choice. Message received! We'll go elsewhere for our staple dinner needs and definitely for our fancy ones."

This option is great if you're dining with a group and want to try most of the menu. The food is served family style and you're given small plates. I liked the rate of food delivery because there wasn't overlap and you had enough time to savor each dish.

"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jacqueline D.","My review is solely based on my experience for the Seattle Restaurant Week 3 Course meal.... I will update this once I come here for a normal dinner (or try out ""Fancy"") as well. Ambiance is super cute - would definitely recommend getting a reservation. A bit dark, but that's what makes it intimate!
The first course for SRW was a variety of appetizers, which allowed me to try multiple appetizers and starters that came from the actual menu. Whooooo! Everything was awesome in their own way - well thought out, and mostly cause we got to try maybe 5 appetizers.
My one annoyance is that we ordered a cheesecake with a rhubarb sauce, but by the time we got it, the rhubarb sauce had soaked into the cheesecake so it was a bit soggy. Really strange that the kitchen didn't catch this but I imagine it was waiting at the counter for a while before making it to our table."

Definitely felt like a true Italian restaurant. I got gnocchi pasta and it was fantastic. Also their wine selection is amazing.
The only issues I had was we got seated at a really really small table. There was enough room for the bread basket and drinks or just our entree and drinks. So very crowded. And it can be a bit spendy. But the food and drink is so worth it.
Perfect for a romantic date night"

I got the italian sausage rigatoni both times and it was SO GOOD. My SO got a chicken dish that was excellent as well. The second time we came it was for a birthday and they figured it out and gave my SO tiramisu with a candle. So nice of them and honestly the BEST tiramisu i've had.
Complimentary first bread basket served with olive oil and garlic. Menu is extensive with lots of options!

My partner picked up dinner for us on the way home from work. I ordered the Spaghetti Calamari and my partner ordered the Rigatoni Salsiccia. Both were very good and the portion size was very generous- we both ate only half of our meals. We split a Caesar salad.
The food here is quite tasty and I would definitely go back to try some of their other dishes. The only other thing I think worth noting about this restaurant is that it is not cheap. If you are okay with that and want good Italian food, then this is definitely a great place to go. A good portion of their pasta dishes run almost $25 which makes it a place that I cannot go to often. However, when I do go, I will most certainly be happy with what I order."

"Tropea Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tropea-ristorante-italiano-redmond-2?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy F.","TLDR: wordy menu. More pasta than meat.
When was the last time you've read a novel? The menu is a mini novel. There is so much text! I appreciate the descriptions of items but a few pictures to alleviate the eyes would be nice. It also takes a while to read everything before you order because there's just so much to read. Not being Italian doesn't help since the names of each dish are Italian so you are forced to read the description. Maybe I'm just lazy but really I'm just hungry.
Very dimly lit so picture quality will be poor but it's a good romantic setting. Check out those giant frames with the wine bottles!
Service: wait to be seated, table service, order at the table, your check will be brought to you.
Complimentary bread and oil: bread is served cold and is in large slices. I like the chewiness of the bread but it's otherwise tasteless without the oil. Generous portion of oil with LOTS of garlic.
Rigatoni Amatriciana: rigatoni is great but there isn't very much pancetta--it felt like just pasta and sauce really. The meat to pasta ratio wasn't well balanced in this dish. Loads of sliced onion and tomato sauce though. A little too much onion in my opinion but the sauce is good."

When we arrived, there was a wait so that was a good sign. When the food came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The Margherita pizza tasted like school lunch. No sign of fresh mozzarella and only shreds of basil. For dinner, I got the truffle chicken. For a $30 CHICKEN dish, I was expecting to be mind blown but I could taste no sign of truffle. It was either masked with the pounds of butter or none was actually in there. The pasta was bland as well because it comes with the same sauce as the chicken ($5 up charge to change the sauce). Service was good but I don't think we will be returning."

The portion sizes are a little small compared to the price, but you will not leave still hungry. The table bread is very mediocre - they should think about baking their own bread or at least serving it warm to customers! The olive oil dipping cup is full of spices and garlic which helps offset the blandness of the bread. Not the best Italian food I've had on the Eastside, but certainly not the worst."
"Tropea Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tropea-ristorante-italiano-redmond-2?osq=Italian+Food","Travis N.","Borderline 1/2. Went here as my Thai place next door was closed.
Over priced. Had the pollo limone - sauce was soupy and literally tasted like the bile you barf up at the end of a good puking session. 26 for the plate and barely any pasta on the plate - maybe $3 of product on the plate. Service was very slow with only half the tables full inside. Inside was very hot as well - no AC and actually outside felt colder when I left.
Also if the place has to force you to buy $8 of product you're in trouble. I have never seen a ""minimum"" purchase on any Italian restaurant menu.
I will not be returning."

I usually find Italian food overpriced and uninteresting, but the pasta at this place is solid. Lots of vegetarian choices. The marinara sauce is full of flavors. My dish was hearty without feeling too heavy, a problem I have with lots of Italian restaurants. The price seems a little high, but the portions are very generous. This is traditional, basic Italian at its best. Can't wait to try the Sicilian pizza!"

We decided to check it out.
I couldn't be more pleased with the service & food here. It's my new fave creamy pasta (Italian) restaurant. I swear the seafood Fetti was so F*n bomb!!!! We got complimentry dessert too. It was such a delight to be service with care! Deff will be coming back. & will spread the word of love of this place, will recommend it to friends!!"
"Tropea Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tropea-ristorante-italiano-redmond-2?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa F.","Tropea is our go-to date night spot on the Eastside, as well as great place to bring out of town guests due to the extensive menu options (particularly the pasta!).
Great, friendly service, options to sit inside or outside and authentic, southern Italian cuisine make this our fave Italian restaurant on the Eastside. The patio area is small, with approximately 5 tables, but is a comfortable little Oasis and nicely shielded from the parking area with shrubbery.
So far we have tried the caprese (with burrata, if available), calamari impanantate, lasagna, ravioli Mari Monte, a risotto special with seafood and tiramisu. Would highly recommend all. Tiramisu was the best I have had, including in Italy. The calamari was lightly breaded and fried and not too greasy. We have twice ordered it with the spicy tomato sauce included with the calamari diavola and would highly recommend. I often dream about the amazing flavor and creaminess of the ravioli Mari Monte and it is probably my favorite dish.
While the prices may be a touch high, we found the portions to be massive and would need to pack up at least half our entree to go.
Delish- go check it out !!"
"Tropea Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tropea-ristorante-italiano-redmond-2?osq=Italian+Food","Sarah A.","What a delightful spot for a dinner out in Redmond! It's a super popular spot during peak times (dinner and weekend dinners especially) so come early or expect to wait.
Portions are generous, service is attentive and food is well prepared. We tried both a special and a classic menu item and loved them both. We shared a salad which was easily big enough for two. The dessert was the least favorite part so I'll probably skip that next time but all in all this is a great spot! Sometimes these ""suburban institutions"" don't live up to their reputation but Tropea totally does - a must visit if you're in the area and worth a trip if you want some classic Italian dishes in a kitchu restaurant with friendly family feel."

The place filled up with the first hour of opening. The ingredients are fresh, cooked to order. The noodles on both our dishes were perfecto al dente. Hubs had the veal- it was tender and flavorful. I had the spaghetti agli olio- it was dynamite!!!!
Chocolate mouse was delicious, but too rush for just one- it should be shared. Same with the chocolate torte - and hubs had an after dinner espresso and said it was great.
Wonderful late afternoon date!"

We also got a free side of sliced bread with olive oil soaked in garlic. It was okay but wish the bread was a bit less dense and not cold.
I ordered the Gina Maria and bf got the lasagna. If you don't like parmesan make sure to let them know as they top it on all dishes. Lasagna comes in a cast iron and is piping hot. It was still bubbling while being served. The Gina Maria was very good and portions large. Had to pack leftovers. Service was good and attentive.

After much debate on where to eat, picky 10 year old daughter, we landed on Soprano's. This would be our first visit here....and, not our last. My wife and I couldn't believe that they have been open for two years. We ordered from the wine list, a bottle yielded $5 off the full bottle and the Montepulciano was good. We ordered two appetizers that were okay, caprese salad and toasted ravioli. My wife ordered the carbonara, picky daughters ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I ordered the gorganzola pancetta gnocchi. All the entrees were delicious and the server told us the sauces as well as the pasta are all made in house. For dessert, we did the massive tiramisu, and I would have liked to try the baklava or something else next time too. The bill was not bad for all of that, and the service was incredible.
We will be back..."

"Soprano’s Antico","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sopranos-antico-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wennie H.","Came here on a whim and left with every intention to come back. A few days ago, I walked past Antico wondering how long it had been here, it was empty and I was surprised since it looked new. My partner wanted pasta and we wanted something close but not our usual spots, in comes Soprano's Antico. A quick glance at their online menu solidified it for me.
We came in and there was one other table there, it was a group of 3 elderly men. It was very endearing. The decor is kitschy but everything was nice and spacious. The server/host/bartender was super nice and accommodating. I really liked her and how she treated everyone who walked in with so much genuine kindness.
Onto food, I had the Brooklynn calzone, baked with less cheese and more veggies. You also have the option to have it deep fried! She said it was really big and made for good leftovers, when it came to the table, I was pretty intimidated with the size...knowing I wouldn't finish it- I did though...despite everyone's disbelief. The calzone wasn't bad, I think had there been the regular amount of cheese it wouldn't have needed a little extra salt and pepper but it was good. The crust was really soft and crispy, the interior stayed hot the entire time I was eating. Gf ordered the spaghetti with marinara and it came with the best toasted garlic bread. The spaghetti was good, the noodles had a chew and the sauce had a nice sweetness to it. The restaurant boasts homemade pasta, so for the price points, it's worth it."

This last time I ordered the cheese special and as far as cheese pizza goes it really hit the spot. The cheese was fresh and high quality, the dough was the perfect texture of crisp and soft in parts and the sauce was slightly sweet creating a perfect contrast to the saltiness of the cheese. I also have ordered their tiramisu twice and it's one of the best I have had. I'm big on the cream part and not as much interested in all the cake. Their tiramisu is the right amount of cream to cake with the cake being moist with just enough espresso flavor. The amount they give you is more than double what I would normally receive at most restaurants. This is is definitely one of my favorite pizza places."

We have gotten to know the owners and staff and they are always asking for feedback. They care about their customers and work very hard.
The only improvement I would suggest someday is if there is a way to muffle the noise of conversation. But that is a good sign that their customers are so happy and comfortable that the animation carries through the place when it is busy. They always have nIce blues or jazz or other music on low in the background and a silent tv with your favorite sports in the bar.
We have been to Brunch a few times too and all I have tasted is delicious as well."
"Saltoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saltoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","B. Marie J.","This is a nice neighborhood restaurant/bar. I usually call in my special order of pizza and am able to pick it up within 15-20 minutes. The staff is great - they get to know the regulars and always have a warm greeting for regulars and non-regulars a like.
The bar is a good size (medium-to large) in a square shape with plenty of space and it has a TV (usually with sports) and a decent sized restaurant area that I often see friends or family dining. In the summertime there's outside seating as well. The parking isn't bad (except on a Friday night) but street parking is also available in the area.
I'd recommend this spot for comfort food or small special occasions."
"Saltoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saltoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Laura V.","Their brunch menu sounded so good, so came here hungry on a Sunday morning. First, I really liked the interior and the seating arrangements. I had read the reviews before and knew it was a slower paced restaurant. So I came prepared with The NY Times.
There were about four or five other tables, so it was pretty slow there. My server was prompt and helpful.
I ordered a crab frittata and beignets. Opened the paper and started to read. The beignets came out after 20 minutes. They were good and I was hungry. They came with a berry sauce that made them a lot better.
But you don't want to fill up on doughnuts or you get that sickish feeling of being hungry and full at the same time. So, waited for my frittata.
It was another half hour before my food came. I'm almost finished reading the paper and reduced to reading sections of the paper I never read. And, starving. I wish I would have been checked on, to give me an idea of the status of my order. In a fairly empty restaurant, an hour wait for breakfast food seems too long.
The crab frittata here came in a cute cast iron skillet. But a cast iron skillet when I cook, is to impair a nice crust on the food. This cast iron skillet rendered the frittata into a brown scorched mass. When I saw that it was overheated, I tried to immediately scrape it all out of this pan, to stop the cooking process and see if I could save it. No, the entire sides of the egg had formed a stubborn hard crust on the pan. I almost wanted to cry with disappointment. I so wanted to eat that frittata. But even in my hungry state it was inedible. My server offered to have the kitchen make another one, but I can't wait another hour.
The frittata came with a nice fruit salad, including blueberries. But please take off those little brown stem parts off the top of the blueberries. It makes me think they were not washed, as you would notice the brown tops.
Came hungry. Waited an hour. Food very over cooked. Left hungry. This equals a sad experience."
"Saltoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saltoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nora J.","This place has some potential. The staff was very friendly and it was done well. They make a really weird old fashioned. The bartender told they did and interesting take on the manhattan but not the old fashioned. I couldn't drink it and that's saying a lot. I would never order it again. The decor is nice and warm. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and it was odd too. It was really sweet, almost like sweet potatoes. I knew asking for salt wouldn't help so I ate it. The mushrooms and sauce helped to take the sweetness down a notch but it's not the savory still I'm used too. The pasta was cooked well. Overall, I can't say I drive here as a visitor again but the story behind the new ownership is cool."
"Saltoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saltoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Eric D.","Great food for reasonable price. I highly recommend the steak with Caper salsa verde, and the butternut squash pasta for entrees. You can't go wrong with the spicy prawns or chick peas as a appetizer.

The food was good but we were not offered bread, the portions were tiny and there was no salad or side veggies. We weren't asked if wanted ""to start with a salad"". I expect to take leftovers home in an Italian restaurant.

Walking in, the place is a little dated and dark....a little update remodel would do some good? The seating accommodations were good considering we where a pretty large party but access was limited so if you needed to get up be mindful of where you choose to sit.
Menu was good, I had checked it out before we came to have an idea of what to order and looked at reviews etc. As the food came out most was ok, not as great as what I expected and the portions are on the smaller side. Our waitress and servers were sub par, handing dishes to the closest person to them instead of asking or knowing who ordered what.

Not only does it offer great food and customer service, it seems to carry great stories in peoples hearts. Went in around 4:45, which is 15 minutes before opening, I was waiting outside and I have met Some wonderful people waiting as well. One gentlemen told me that its his favorite spot with his gf, and that they visit at least 3 times a month. Another couple who were waiting as well, told me that its their tradition to sit by the mirror located at the corner. Regulars here, seems to have special traditions and stories with their loved ones. Before even entering, I felt a cozy vibe.
Ordered the Caesar salad, calamari, house-made fennel sausage pizza, and finally the butternut squash ravioli. All the foods came out at an prompt timing and all very delicious. Calamari was interesting because it had pieces of chick peas. Not complaining, just commenting. (Hehe)
Being one of the first to enter the restaurant, I was surprised to see how pack this place got middle of my dinner. This place almost seems under rated by yelpers and its almost like a secret!

It was some Tunisian aioli pepper thing. Never tasted anything like it. With my tap apple cider. What a contrast in flavors! The bread we ordered for appetizer was right out of the oven hot and fresh and delicious! Compliments all around the table from the family about the high quality of the food.

I was disappointed to hear they don't have happy hour and are only open for dinner. There is potential for weekend bunch or a great happy hour menu if they wanted to expand a bit."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Wallingford","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-wallingford-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Lori C.","We dined there for lunch on a Monday. Neapolitan pizza is my boyfriends favorite so I knew this was going to be a hit since they are certified from Naples as a legit pizzeria.
We were seated right away and had prompt service. After browsing their menu online prior to arriving I wanted the clam pasta but it turns out on their special menu there was a even more delicious sounding clam dish. That Monday they did not have clams. Very disappointing to have it on your menu and even more on your specials menu then can't serve it. I went with the bolognese, it was quite tasty.
My boyfriend had the Leonardo 10 inch lunch sized pizza. It was perfect. He likes it cooked longer so the crust is crisper and they happily delivered his request.
Service was great all the way through. Tentative, efficient, and friendly.
Tip: we used a ChinookBook coupon for $5.00 off and brought gift cards from Costco only $79 for $100 worth of value.
We will be back for sure. Great experience only 4 stars since they didn't have the two things I would have first order on the menu."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Wallingford","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-wallingford-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Kristine H.","We are fans of Tutta Bella and have visited most of the locations in the city. This location has a parking lot on site and also street parking when available.
The food is fresh and who doesn't love a good wood-fired pizza! I especially like that I can substitute goat cheese for mozzarella since I am allergic to cow's mill. The shakers of cheese also contain Pecorino Romano which is made with 100% sheep's milk so another win for me!
I love their beet salad packed with roasted beets, slivers of red onion, pistachios, and goat cheese tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. I usually go overboard with fresh ground black pepper but it's so good that way.
We've had a LOT of pizzas here over the years and some of them have included:
- Filomena with olive oil base, roasted asparagus, ham, caramelized onions, and goat cheese.
- Michele with pomodoro, Isernio's chicken sausage, Calabrian salami and chiles, smoked mozzarella di bufala, and fresh basil.
- Gioia with extra virgin olive oil, prosciutto di Parma, fresh eggs, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and shaved Parmigiano.
- Pietro with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, salame, Isernio's Italian sausage, chili flake, and fresh basil.
- Capricciosa with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, artichoke, mushroom, kalamata, and fresh basil.
- Hazan with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, provola, whole milk mozzarella, Calabrian salami, and mushroom.
- Margherita with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, grana, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.
Their Napoli salad is one of my favourite salads with ribbons of romaine, chicken breast, salami, crumbled pancetta, tomato, carrot, artichoke, kalamata olive, gorgonzola, tossed in their house dressing. For an additional $5, you can also turn a regular size salad into a salad pizza served on pizza crust dough.
I've also had their Polpette (Neapolitan meatballs) and they were deliciously savory. The Sauté Di Vongole was also delicious: Manila clams, white wine, macerated tomato, chili flakes, and oregano. The clams also come with toasted house-made bread and make for an excellent sharing appetizer.
I'd recommend signing up for their email newsletter. You'll get a free dessert for your birthday (tiramisu, trust me) and know about seasonal pies when they arrive. Two of these examples include:
- Calabrese with EVOO, black mission figs, prosciutto di parma, goat cheese, rosemary, balsamic reduction.
- Capannina - extra virgin olive oil, fresh mozzarella, Meyer lemon, prosciutto di Parma, and Grana Padano.
Lunch is served during the week, M-F from 11:00 to 15:00 with the price range from $6 to $13. They also have a HH menu every day from 15:00 to 18:00 and again from 21:00 to close.
If you are averse to kids of any age, this location is frequented by a lot of families with young children. Some evenings when there are a LOT of diners, there is a cacophonous din inside from all the kids and adults and general bustle of the servers and kitchen. One of my friends felt it was too loud so we opted to eat on their patio despite the slight chill in the air."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Wallingford","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-wallingford-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Alana B.","The Roberto pizza was one of the best Neapolitan styled pizzas I've ever had. The combination of flavors and ingredients were unique but so harmonious. Both my boyfriend and I were taken back by how good it was, especially with an additional Parmesan and pepper flakes.
The burrata itself was good as well, but the pepper/olive tapenade it comes with was overpowering and weakened the dish overall. However, the butter soaked bread that came with it was deviously good on its own and with the cheese as well.
The Caesar salad was pretty good for it being a classic. However, the chicken was weirdly cut up and looked sparse - it was mostly romaine with not enough croutons and chicken.
The drinks were also good, Sorrento is a solid frou-frou drink and tasted really really good without the alcohol overpowered. Boyfriend had a blended red that was really light in flavor, but wasn't the worst.
Overall, we had a good experience. The service was a little lackluster but the restaurant itself wasn't too popping. We drove by on a Friday night and it definitely was busy so I'm sure it was just the night we went. They gave us a free dessert for the boy's bday which we got to choose - a nice perk. Will definitely be back for that Roberto and to try out their other dishes!"

We love the decor at this location. It's suitable for a date nite or friends meet ups. Everything on the menu is delicious. We have tried the pear salad, bruschetta, minestrone, many pizzas, and their gelato.
You can swap ingredient and make it however you want. Including vegan pizzas and let me just say they make them amazing however you want your pizzas to be!
Two people can easily eat $60-70 for reference."

I had read a few reviews and it looked like a definite stop if we were in the area. Well, it popped up when we were at the zoo as a place nearby.
Upon entering, I was a little nervous if it would actually be good. The restaurant was large so I wondered if it was just a large scale typical chain pizza joint... Wrong!
The chew of the crust was so delicious - not like the oily/heavy more American style pizzas. We tried the pizza was prosciutto and arugula. Next time I would want to try one with red sauce. We don't have many options like this in Hawaii, so it's a treat for us.
We also tried the nutella calzone ($10). It was good but I don't know if I'd get it again. The calzone outside was like the pizza, nice and chewy.
Service was friendly and fast (but not rushed). I would definitely come back if we are in the area again.
I can't speak to parking here as we walked. They did have a small lot and it looked like street parking was available as well."

I didn't order their pizza, but my friends did and it looked pretty good, but this review is based off my of dish. I order their Bolognese and I had pretty high expectation since their pizza was known to be good and they're an Italian restaurant. The pasta tasted store bought and not fresh at all, along with their sauce it was not flavorful. Their had carrots in their sauce which was something I haven't had in a bolognese. Their portion was small and for $17.50, it was definitely not worth it. I should have ordered a pizza as it looked pretty good.
Our waiter was pretty awesome, he was hesitant on our 7 guest table outside, but it looked like he was okay with it and was able to meet all our needs and was super attentive in our drinks/water."

Came here for dinner with family and to celebrate a birthday. You can bring your own cake in which is nice and a bonus. The atmosphere itself is really cute, they have lights up and it's overall just a really nice vibe. They also have dough and wiki sticks for kids to play with.
They have several pizza options, which you can get as a 10"" more personal size or a larger 13"" size for sharing. Four adults and a kid got two 13"" and one 10"" and had plenty. They also have beer, wine and cocktails.
My girlfriend and I split a half cheese, half prosciutto e funghi (mushroom, mozzarella, prosciutto and basil). Once you pile on toppings it definitely becomes more of a fold it to eat it or use a fork and knife situation. It was good but again nothing really stood out to us.
Service was decent. I did sit with an empty water glass for awhile and other refills were a bit slow. Our waitress was nice but not around much.
Overall it's cute inside and has decent pizza."

The staff was absolutely impeccable and understanding of our situation. They got us in and out quickly and split the checks exactly how we wanted in such a short amount of time. The food was just a little above average, but a really good value since I shared garlic knots, lasagna, and a 13"" Roberto with two others for around $15 each. The pistachio puree in the Roberto was kind of strange for my taste, but should be enjoyable for anyone who likes a sort of unique nutty taste on their pizza."

They also have a 13"" available. Their crust is amazing!! Wood-fired pizza at its best!
I am in love with their Margerita DOC (on days when I want simple and classic,) the Mediterranean (piled high with great veggies,) and a newly discovered favorite is the Roberto - extra virgin olive oil, pistachio puree, italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, smoked buffalo mozzarella, basil... YUMMMMM!!!!! And we always get the Beet salad - with pistachios, pickled red onion and goat cheese. So fresh and delicious! It's also on the HH menu for $8 - shareable size. Yay!

Their Pizzas taste really similar to the Pizzas I got when I was in Napoli, some of the ingredients are different (non-napolitan) but many of them are the same. If you like wood-fired artisan Pizza, you will love this place.
I have ordered many different things through multiple visits and nothing has been disappointing. In fact, the plates are usually really good. The Neapolitan Lasagna is excellent; if you want one, make sure you get there early because they run out of them quickly. Also, try avoid common weekend hours, the place tends to get really busy. S
Aim for the happy hour (3-6p, 9-close) instead and you will have the place for yourself and save money.
I have not tried the other branches but I recommend this one overall."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Wallingford","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-wallingford-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Allison L.","Tutta Bella is really close to my house, so it was one of the first restaurants that I tried when I moved to Seattle. At first I thought it's going to be a super casual pizza place, like Mod Pizza or Blaze, but it is actually a much nicer restaurant than that. It's an upscale-casual place with an unassuming exterior. However, the interior is very well decorated (kind of like Maggiano's or similar restaurants) and it was bustling when I went on a Sunday evening around 8PM.
I chose to get takeout from the restaurant and I was in a pasta mood that night, so I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese. I waited about 15 minutes for them to prepare my meal, paid the $17 for the pasta, and went on my way home.
When I went home, I took out my pasta, and it was smaller than I expected. I was expecting $17 pasta to last at least more than a meal, but I was able to finish the whole thing in one sitting. This does say one thing about the pasta tho-- it was really good! The noodles were not soggy, and the sauce had a hint of sweetness on top of the normal tomato-y flavor. It made for a very filling (although very carb-y) meal.
Since I live close to here, I'd think I wanna come back and try their pizza some day (since that is what they are famous for!). However, I don't think I can afford to be a regular here because it is a bit too pricey for a fresh college grad like me. I would recommend this for special occasions though, like a birthday or a promotion."

We had the Roberto (extra virgin olive oil, pistachio puree, italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, smoked buffalo mozzarella, basil) which even on its own was insanely good. But our server, Kai (?sp) brought us some honey to drizzle over it. Talk about gilding the lily. The crust was absolutely perfect. We've been thinking about it all afternoon :) I kinda wish we'd ordered one more (we got the 10""), had a slice each and brought the rest home. We visit Seattle several times a year (our daughter and her family) and we will go there every time, I've no doubt. And did I mention the wonderful service?

The appetizer was cheese with roasted peppers came when toasted breads was a hit but only came with~4 pieces of breads. We ran out of bread quickly and asked our server for more and he brought us about 2 pieces more. He was very apologetic about it and said because the bread was free he wasn't allowed to bring out more.
We got a half and half pizza and followed our waiter's recommendation and both were excellent. At the end we were given free gelato for my boyfriend's birthday as well. It was so creamy and delicious. Only thing is they don't have parking but you can find street parking pretty easily."

I was pleasantly impressed with the food quality and flavors. The beet salad with goat cheese and pumpkin seeds is cravable. The mozzarella salad with kalamata olives and vegetables was fresh and tasty. The pizza crust, while a bit limp in the middle, had good flavor and the toppings were good. And to wash all of that down, Tutta Bella offers a selection of wines, beers, and cocktails that are quite enjoyable.
The restaurant itself has a lot of space and it's divided in sections: Outdoor patio, main dining area, a partially enclosed bar, and an area designated for large groups. If you have a dinner event involving a large group such as a rehearsal dinner, birthday, or other celebration, this is a good and reasonably priced option. However, the main dining room is completely overrun with young children. Maybe they have a great children's menu? Point being, if you're looking for a quiet place to relax, this isn't it. But if you don't mind a room full of loud, fidgety kids and you enjoy pizza, this is a good option.
There is a small parking lot for restaurant patrons but it can get full quickly. Metered street parking is available and a couple of blocks away you may be lucky enough to snag unmetered parking on residential streets."

Like Santa Claus, they do exist, my friends!
Instantly, Via Rosa 11 sets the mood of feeling as if you are walking into a restaurant in Venice that is amongst the cobblestone streets, through the arched passageways, away from the shops, just tucked away with a quaint outside seating area covered in beautiful vine covered lattices with opened doors welcoming you home. But a home unlike any other, this is a home with a framed photo of Sophia Lauren, homemade pastas lining the counter, and a beautiful decadent white and blue tiled wood burning oven. Every detail is absolutely perfect.

I knew absolutely nothing about this Rolling Bay restaurant, except that local resident and avid Yelper George S. mentioned takeout lasagne. I'm probably am the biggest Italian cuisine fan, but never travelled there. Yet.
After stops at nearby Bay Hay and Feed and the newbie wine tasting at Rolling Bay Winery, it was time to have some lunch. What a phenomenal culinary find ! Via Rosa 11 functions both as an Italian retail market and restaurant.
The counter staff are friendly and patient with newcomers who have to ponder the vast choices. I kid you not, it was tough. Plus the servings are generous, a challenge since I was dining solo.
There are daily specials, salads, soups, antipasti, panini, pizza, pasta including ravioli, lasagne, gnocchi, crostini, desserts, ad naseum.
I can't imagine someone not finding something fantastic to enjoy.
For Seattleites, it's like a mashup of Il Corvo, Pasta and Co., Delaurenti's, and PFI, but scaled down. It also exudes a tight community vibe, a lovely open food prep/ kitchen area, plus a wood fired oven.
I ended up ordering the Burrata salad ($12) with arugula, burrata, cherry or grape tomatoes, olives, pickled onion, baby peppers, radish all nicely dressed in balsamic, plus opted for two (not four) crostini. Next time there is polpo/octopus salad....
Plus who could resist fresh pasta cooked to order with your choice of sauce ($13)? This handmade pasta aficionado selected paparadelle with bolognese. Lovely presentation...tasted wonderful on 6/9 and even when microwaved at work today on 6/13. That's quality goodness!
Lots of beverage choices too, but the iced lemon water was a nice touch.
While I was texting back and forth with George S. via Yelp, I paused and asked the gentleman weaving between tables whether he was Pino, the restaurant owner.
Indeed he was and he regaled me with vivid stories of growing up eating fresh, seasonal, coastal food from Imperia in the Liguria region. He even showed me pictures and postcards off the kitchen wall. Family anecdotes and inspirations are the best!
He said he never goes to ""work""...truly this is a genuine individual who loves what he does and wants to share that with you. He is living the dream!
When he realized that I visited here on a whim for my birthday, he kindly gave me free cannoli. Mmmmm, so tasty. I'll have to be prepared next time have a cooler and order the pan of tiramisu.
As I'm busing my table (the entire place was filling up with customers amid the kitchen bustling kitchen activity), I was called over to see one of the culinary staff pull out large porchettas from the oven. I can only imagine that sliced thin in a panini sandwich or an open faced ciabatta.
Yes, I ventured in and dined alone at Via Rosa 11. But the welcoming atmosphere and delicious cuisine made me feel like a Bainbridge Island regular on a whirlwind field trip to Liguria.
Grazie mille, Chef Pino and of course, George S."

The 5 of us ordered:
-Pizza of the day with prosciutto and burrata: voted as the best dish of the meal by the fiance. The crust is very well done and made in the wood fired oven.
-Mushroom pappardelle: my favorite dish of the meal. They put so much mushroom in there and the pappardelle is so fresh.
-Buratta salad: my dad's favorite. You get a very generous serving of buratta with the house salad.
-Side of cauliflower: a good side. Not a standout but good to get some vegetables in.
-Seafood on squid ink linguine: this was the first dish I chose but we all agreed they dropped the ball a bit. The linguine was way too soft and the dish overall was a bit salty.
All in all, we really enjoyed our meal here. We'd definitely come back but will skip the seafood linguine next time."

It's kind of outdoorsy with tables and benches outside for you to sit. The best time to eat is lunch or late lunch, because in the evening, the flies start coming around. However, they do have space inside, but limited, so get there early. Service was great; the ladies that work there help you if it's your first time, and they are accommodating to your needs.

We are tough customers when it comes to fresh-made pasta and brick-oven pizza.
So much so, in fact, that when they're in the US they usually avoid Italian food -- not just because it's usually too Americanized for their tastes, but because they will freely tell you they're kind of sick of it at that point, and sorta want a cheeseburger and a salad with ranch dressing.
My mother has actually suggested of her own accord when visiting me that we go to Via Rosa 11, which should tell you all you need to know.
The pizzas are thin-crust and a great size for one very hungry person, with potential for leftovers if you're not ravenous. *They also offer burrata.* I've never asked them if it's actual bufala, but it's so tender that it hasn't mattered to me enough to ask. On nights when I feel like splurging on comfort food, I pick up some fresh-made noodles and a container of one of their sauces -- bolognese is a personal favorite, and theirs never lets me down (get the wild boar bolognese if you're feeling especially fancy). I've bought a container of their meatballs in sauce and just eaten those for a meal with a salad. I enjoyed the meatball sub I had, but I can't speak as to the rest of the sandwiches, because when I'm there I'm not usually wanting sandwiches!
The only 'downsides':
1 - Limited seating. If they're slammed, that might present a challenge.
2 - The location means that I didn't learn about this spot until long after I wish I had known it existed, in spite of frequenting the feed store...and I imagine there are other people out there who haven't discovered it yet, either.
It's worth a trip. If you can swing it to hit Bay Hay & Feed and Via Rosa 11 on the same day, I personally think that those two locations alone are worth a trip all the way from Seattle and beyond."

Fresh handmade pasta, wood fired pizza, savory soups, roasted veggies...so delicious. I would return just for their bolognese sauce, so so good. Thank goodness they had Uber there as this place was a bit far from the marina and all the shops. This place serves nice sized portions along with good quality and this results in a winning combo and a 5 star Yelp review!! Inside seating is limited but if it's nice out like it was today, there's more seating outside."

"Via Rosa 11","https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-rosa-11-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Jonie L.","Via Rosa is about a ten minute drive from downtown, so only makes sense to go if you have a car (versus walking onto the ferry if visiting from Seattle), and also means you won't just stumble upon it while exploring town.
This place is so fun! They make fresh pastas (which you can buy by the pound too), and you can mix/match what pastas you want with what sauces. There's a good variety too, and they offer suggestions on what pastas go with which sauces if you need some guidance. Though lunch price is $13 for a casual meal, portion size make sense, and enough food even if it doesn't look like it - comes with two pieces of yummy bread too. Both pastas I tried were delicious! Pastas were perfectly cooked, and sauces - both pesto and bolognese, were great. I also appreciated that they both came out super hot!
Also, service was really friendly - we felt really welcomed!
Overall, Via Rosa is a gem on the island, and I'd go back next time I'm in town - can't pass up on a good plate of fresh made pasta!"

"La Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jon L.","La Pasta is a local pasta maker that sells their pastas at numerous farmers' markets across the Seattle area. I like that their pastas come in many flavors and are not just the usual egg pasta noodles.
I had a black squid ink pasta dish at a food truck earlier this year and was interested in making these noodles at home. La Pasta was the only place that I knew that sold this type of pasta. Price was reasonable as it was $6 for a pound of fresh pasta.
I had some nice meals with this pasta and would buy it again. I would recommend asking for some pointers on how to best cook the pasta when you buy it however. It was a bit of trial and error for me in this regard."

Very friendly staff and reasonable prices. This is going to be a neighborhood go-to!"
"La Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda B.","I usually buy their products from the LFP farmers market, but during the off-season for the farmers market I was kinda out of luck. I'm happy that the gentleman had mentioned they have a storefront, and after googling I found that it's not far from my house and conveniently on my way home from work.
I've tried the fresh egg pastas, a few raviolis, and tonight picked up some kale pesto!
The kale pesto was delicious, creamy and had a nice kick to it.
The pasta is fresh, and keeps very well in the freezer if you ever find that you want to stock up for a few months during off season for farmers markets. It cooks up very nicely, and even when reheated the texture stays nice and chewy
The raviolis could use a minute or two extra from the time listed on the packaging, but other than that are a perfect dough to filling ratio."

I've thoroughly enjoyed everything I've purchased from La Pasta. My favorite is their gnocchi, paired with their pomodoro sauce and the ground sausage sold there. The employees are super friendly, and a great resource for suggesting new things to try or new yummy combinations.
While you're there - get some cannolis for dessert. Soooooo good. It's the real deal and stuffed to order (so the shells don't get soggy). You won't be disappointed!"

I am a hell of a cook myself, I love cooking from scratch. After a long day at work, grabbing some sauce and pasta here is such a treat.

Food: 4 stars
Price: 3 stars
Overall: 3.5 stars
Food:
On the box, it claimed the cooking time to be 6 minutes. However, the edges of our ravioli was still pretty hard. I think I cooked it for like 12 minutes, just like how I usually cook my dumpling (you know, add cold water once it boils, repeat 3 times). I used a regular tomato sauce with some stir-fried onion slices to accompany it. I'm out of cheese powders, so I just added some Italian seasoning and seaweed (I KNOW I KNOW! JUST FOR THE LOOK OK? haha!). It came out yummy even though I'm not a fan of ravioli.
Price:
My husband got 35 pieces of smoked salmon ravioli for ~$12, which is a bit pricy for me since I'm cheap. But it's an okay price as ravioli are usually really expensive in restaurants.
Overall:
Consider it's easy to cook, I'd give it a 4 stars. However, the cooking time it definitely more than 6 minutes unlike you like HARD ravioli edges!
BTW, my husband got the pasta from the La Pasta in Kirkland Parkplace, so don't kill me if you can't find your smoke salmon ravioli in this store!"

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

The server was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. I really enjoyed everything about dining here.
The issue that I have is that I got food poisoning from their squash pasta. It was delicious when I ate it, but about 90 minutes after I finished eating my stomach began to churn and it continued into an extremely unenjoyable experience. Luckily, my friend had their mac n cheese, which she said was delicious, so she did not get sick. Aside from the bad squash pasta, this is a cool place with a great location. Just be mindful with what you order because it may not sit well."

I imagine if it's super busy it might be a little slow, both food and service, in our case it was timely in both areas.
It was seat yourself when we arrived, which always makes me nervous! It takes attentive staff to properly serve tables they have no idea are seated! The bartender did a great job though, catching all the tables on his continuous circles through the seating area. We stayed awhile so got to see the night staff arriving and the place filling up. The entire staff was super friendly and checked on us regularly.
The wings, the perfect, wings! We ordered several appetizers between the two of us to get a sampling of what they had to offer. Everything was spot on and delicious with some great flavors. The first order of wings was perfection on a plate! Hubby and I gobbled them up pretty fast! We then had to order more, they were that good! Sadly, the second order came out a little under cooked. Same great flavor but definitely needed a few more minutes of heat!
The drinks are creative and tasty with some different combinations and names that make you want to try them. From the food to the service and the window seat sidewalk watching, we'll definitely be back when we're in the neighborhood!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

It has a funky atmosphere.
Nice happy hour menu; it has something for those who are watching their diet and those who are not. Truffle popcorn is fabulous. The mixed nuts have a Sweet covering. The dates were warm and stuffed with goat cheese. Wonderful hummus.
The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.
The cocktail menu is small, but good. I like the wine and beer menu. The prices are very fair. The service has been wonderful.
Great spot; great time. Come visit."

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"

My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."

Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"

Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"

We had deviled eggs, the pork skins, and almonds and olives for snacks before dinner at Cutters. The eggplant dip with the pork skins was the highlight. It was silky smooth, and not like baba ganouj, if that's what you were thinking. There's an off-menu cocktail-with-a-story, if you're interested. Called the Chas, it's bourbon, Cointreau, and other potent tastiness. A Pike Place institution, you must come to Zig Zag if you're in Seattle."

So many fun drinks and yummy snacks. They have one of the most extensive cocktail menus I've ever seen and it was hard to decide on just one (okay, two) to try. For snacks we had the fries which have a great balance of salt and dress black pepper and the crispy pig skin which came with a fantastic aioli.
We arrived around 5:30 and were able to get a seat on their small patio, but the inside looked nice too if the patio is full."

My potato dish was scrumptious but lukewarm. If it was piping hot and service wasn't excruciatingly slow this place would definitely get four stars.

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

The vibe of the place is really relaxed and inviting. It felt like a really fun place to be. The service was great, drinks and food came out in a timely manner. The server was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. I really enjoyed everything about dining here.
The issue that I have is that I got food poisoning from their squash pasta. It was delicious when I ate it, but about 90 minutes after I finished eating my stomach began to churn and it continued into an extremely unenjoyable experience. Luckily, my friend had their mac n cheese, which she said was delicious, so she did not get sick. Aside from the bad squash pasta, this is a cool place with a great location. Just be mindful with what you order because it may not sit well."

I imagine if it's super busy it might be a little slow, both food and service, in our case it was timely in both areas.
It was seat yourself when we arrived, which always makes me nervous! It takes attentive staff to properly serve tables they have no idea are seated! The bartender did a great job though, catching all the tables on his continuous circles through the seating area. We stayed awhile so got to see the night staff arriving and the place filling up. The entire staff was super friendly and checked on us regularly.
The wings, the perfect, wings! We ordered several appetizers between the two of us to get a sampling of what they had to offer. Everything was spot on and delicious with some great flavors. The first order of wings was perfection on a plate! Hubby and I gobbled them up pretty fast! We then had to order more, they were that good! Sadly, the second order came out a little under cooked. Same great flavor but definitely needed a few more minutes of heat!
The drinks are creative and tasty with some different combinations and names that make you want to try them. From the food to the service and the window seat sidewalk watching, we'll definitely be back when we're in the neighborhood!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Monica E.","Let me start by saying that I've never had a bad experience at Maggianos and I love their food, Rigatoni D and the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite so my girlfriends and I decided to try their brunch. We usually go elsewhere but the menu looked great and who can beat $2 Mimosas??
So we had great service by our waiter and were excited for our meals. The mimosas were yummy and my friends ordered the salmon Benedict and the veggie frittata and I couldn't decide on the Benedict or the Hash but finally settled on the Hash since it promised crispy potatoes, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, & roasted garlic. And the photo online looked delish!
But when we got our meals, my friends' dishes were gorgeous, and looked so appetizing and I get my plate and my expectations were dashed when a dish is put in front of me that looked nothing like the photo or what I would expect from Maggianos.
While the Benedict and frittata were picture-worthy, my hash looked like I was being served someone's leftovers. You couldn't make out where the potatoes, peppers, or onions were because it was just a plate full of brown mush with beef. We could see a few pieces of something red here and there and the bread they served was dry except for the bottom that had gotten soggy sitting on top of the brown mush. In the photo, it shows yummy buttered focaccia. It was like they stopped trying when it came to my dish.
I had to pull up the photo that I had seen online to show my friends that expectation did not live up to reality.
I ate most of it and did not complain because I did not want to embarrass my friends but would never order that again, nor did I think it was worth the price since my dish was more expensive than their
gorgeous dishes.
I don't know who thought to send that dish out looking the way it did but I doubt that Maggianos standards are that low. Hoping it was a fluke. But yeah, won't be ordering the dog food looking mush again:(
Photos for comparison: Expectation photos from their online menu vs. photo I took of reality.
Expectation vs. Reality
Gave them 3 stars cause the waiter was friendly & my friends' dishes were great!"
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Dhanashree A.","Just walking into this place you get the old italian place vibe, its decorated with black and white photos, huge antique mirrors, feels a little dingy. Its a very typical italian-american restaurant. The place is huge! There are I think 3 sections, each section can be its own restaurant. I got reservations for this place for a team lunch. We were a group of 9 people. They had plenty of open space and we were seated immediately.
We tried a bunch of things here. Their Lasagna, riggatoni arrabiata, Braised Beef Contadina, chicken parm. I got their Jumbo Lump crab cakes. I am not a big fan saucy, cheesy pastas, so I stayed away from them. The Jumbo Lump Crab cakes are quite opposite to their name, 22$ for two tiny crab cakes, some arugula, and an aioli. Seems quite steep. On the other hand the beef contadina is 27$ for a portion enough for 3 meals?! I know crab cakes are usually pricier, but this is the smallest portion I have seen for the price. The overall verdict was good. Everyone said they liked their pastas. The service was good. We didn't have to ask twice for anything, and we got our food also on time, considering it was a large order.
All in all not a very memorable meal. Given that I don't enjoy the style of food I don't see myself returning, unless its another team lunch and someone chooses this place. There are plenty of better, more authentic italian places in Bellevue. I would prefer going there instead."
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Ibrahim A.","If you are looking for a decent family style American- Italian place, then this is the place to go. This place has a really good service and staff are very accommodating. The quality of the food is decent and their servings are quite big. I went to this place with a large group and we shared a couple of dishes. They also have a kids menu for 7.99 and kids also get free desert with their order . When you order from their main pasta menu they also give you one free pasta dish to take home with you.
Starters
We ordered the Caesar salad and the house salad. They both were good and would recommend trying them out.
Entrees
The dish that really standard out was the Arabiata rigatoni. It had a rich creamy red sauce and lots of good flavor. Another dish I would highly recommend trying out is the shrimp fra Diavola.
Desert
We ended up ordering the desert sampler where you try out 5 types of desserts. I would say my favorite was the tiramisu.
Finally, I would highly recommend giving this place a try, I would say it is one of the best family style American- Italian restaurants with reasonable prices."
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer J.","I went to Maggiano's for dinner last night with some friends as an early holiday celebration. It was one of the few restaurants in the area with reservations available for our party of 8 during this busy season, and I was looking forward to terrific Italian food all day. Sadly, I left disappointed.
But first, the good things: this is a large restaurant, but they pull of a smaller restaurant feel with traditional red 'n white checked tablecloths and fast/friendly service. Our waitress was attentive and came to take our drink orders right away, followed by explaining their extensive menu and telling us about their holiday special (if you order from their Classics menu you get a whole separate entree to take home for free - what a deal)! These Classics included fettucini alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, baked ziti, and lasagna to name a few.
I started by ordering a glass of house merlot. It's 100% my bad that I didn't ask the price of the merlot. I assumed (wrongly) that a glass of house red wine at an Italian chain restaurant would be reasonably priced ($10 or less). Imagine my surprise when the bill came and the glass was $15! It was basically the same price as my entree. It's been awhile since I paid $15 for a glass of house wine. In hindsight, I should have asked. But...ouch.
We started with some calamari, which was pretty good - although it was served with marinara sauce and I felt the two did not pair well. Perhaps a cocktail sauce would have been more fitting. I only had a few calamari, in anticipation of my meal. Soon enough my lasagna arrived. It was a huge portion, and I eagerly dove in with my fork. The first thing I tasted was salt. Now, I love salt. But this was WAYYYY over-salted. I asked my friend, who had also ordered the lasagna, and he said his was salty too. I didn't want to make a fuss, so I ate about 1/3 of it before I couldn't stomach anymore of that salt. I did mention it to the waitress, just as an FYI to pass along to the kitchen (did not expect ANYTHING in return) and she basically could have cared less. Oh well.
The best bite of the meal was the creme brulee, which was HUGE and fun to share with the rest of the table. All in all, though, the entire experience was meh and - for the $70 I shelled out including food, wine, and gratuity I left feeling pretty frustrated. Oh well, at least I got a free ravioli to take home for lunch today. Hoping it's less salty!"

Everything we had was amazing!!! I rarely will enjoy everything ordered at a new restaurant, but this place blew my mind. The garlic bread was to die for. The chicken was the best chicken I've ever had; It was so juicy and flavorful. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak and ravioli so much. Best tasting ravioli we've had so far. To top it off was the great service we had from our server, Vinay. He recommended the garlic bread to us and we're so happy that he did, we couldn't ask for anyone better. We will definitely be coming back here and bringing family/friends."
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Kish M.","I am always on the lookout for a great, neighborhood Italian Restaurant and Maggiano's Little Italy comes very, very close to my ideal comfort eatery.
Let me be clear, Maggiano's is in the heart of downtown Bellevue, you have to park in a parking garage and walk to the restaurant but once inside, it has the right feel and the food was the real deal, yep, I will be eating here often.
First thing was the service, if you have read any of my past reviews you will see I don't judge restaurants on the service, for me it is all about the food and the atmosphere or ambiance if you will but when the service is extraordinary, I just think you should acknowledge it. On the night of my visit I went in alone and was seated in the lounge area so my server was the bartender and her name was Hannah and Hannah was spectacular!!!! To say that she made the whole evening better is an understatement so Hannah, thank you!!
Now the food, my favorite dish in the world, I am talking, if I was on death row my last meal would be Sausage and Peppers, when done right, nothing like it!!! Traditional Sausage and Peppers is an entree served over pasta with some garlic bread. Maggiano's has it as an appetizer, no pasta, just Sausage and Peppers so I almost did not order it which would have been tragic because it was decadently delicious, seriously delicious!!!!
The Sausage and Peppers appetizer could have been a meal but I still ordered an entree because I am a Yelp Foodie, it's what we do.
I ordered the Lasagna, I am a Lasagna snob, NOBODY can make Lasagna like my wife although my sister comes close so I am usually disappointed with restaurant Lasagna but on this day, I was treated to a wonderful, delicious, flavorful, meal that I will be eating many more times in the future!!!
The Lasagna was so good, I ordered one to go and had it for lunch the next day!!!
And, I should have lead with this, they have Dr. Pepper!!!
If you are looking for good Italian food please visit Maggiano's, you will not be disappointed!!!
Until next time my fellow Yelpers, ..... Live Local, ..... Be Local, ..... and whenever possible, ..... BUY LOCAL!!!!!!"

For $7, kid gets an entree, drink plus a dessert and the best part is that the portion is large enough for an adult too. For the price, my kids' lunch for the next day is covered.
My favorite dish is their Braised Beef al Forno. The truffle peppercorn sauce is so yummy and completely coats the tender beef. The flavor is rich and took me right the truffle heaven."

I used Open Table to reserve a table but from the hostess reaction, seems like it wasn't received properly.
My date and I were seated momentarily, but near the kitchen. My date was so captivating and the service by Ernesto negated this location.
We settled on wine selections, and entrees. Marco's Dinner for Two - 2 entrees, 1 starter or 2 side salads, 1 dessert and 2 take-home entrees!
Each of choices were good. Nothing over the top, or to write home to Mom about."
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Ron M.","Maggiano's gets a lot of crap, but the truth is that if you have kids (and I have 4) then they are going to love this place a lot more than a snobby ""authentic"" Italian restaurant. While I'd avoid the terrible flatbread pizza, most everything else is quite good and they have large enough portions that always result in bringing something home (plus some items come with a free extra serving to bring home).
You can't go wrong with the lasagna or spagetti with meatballs, but my favorite is the veal parmesan.
Great bread, decent wine, fun for the kids and everybody leaves with a full stomach - can't beat that."
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Amandeep S.","I've been coming to Maggiano's for years for different occasions (graduations, anniversaries, Mother's Day, prom dinner, etc) - in fact, it's been nearly 9 years since my first visit and I must say that it has changed a lot. If I had left my review 7-8 years ago I would have easily given a 4, but after my experience in the last couple of years and especially a few weeks ago, I can't justify it. I have rated it a 3 here taking into consideration my many years of visits, but really my up-to-date rating is a 2.5.
I came in on a Sunday evening for my anniversary dinner with my husband and in-laws, having made a reservation ahead of time. Despite the reservation and the restaurant not being so busy, we had to wait for a table for 10-15 min. Once seated it took a while for our server to come and get us our drinks and then our orders. I have not had bad service here before in this way so I was pretty shocked.
The physical menu has also changed - it took some time to realize there wasn't just a back and front part to the menu, but rather a second page in between that you had to pull out. They also added a deal where if you order any classic or speciality pasta, you get to bring one classic home for free. This sounds like an amazing deal (which for the price it is) but to me it speaks volumes about quality of the food and the overall standard of the restaurant. It reminded me very much of Olive Garden.
Our food was also not as good as usual. I ordered the gnocchi, with added grilled chicken (what I typically order) and my husband got the manicotti (also a typical order for at least one of us), and we were both very disappointed in the food. Mine tasted very bland, with barely any sauce at all and the portion size was quite smaller than it used to be. The manicotti - tho very rich - also tasted bland and honestly too creamy with no flavor. My in-laws ordered salmon, which they liked, and the orichette pasta, which they didn't particularly care for.
The take home pastas we chose as part of the deal were the Rigatoni - only my husband ended up eating one of them, the other we threw away since it wasn't very tasty and we knew no one would eat.
I don't think I'll be back any time soon, which is a bummer as I've enjoyed this restaurant for nearly a decade :("
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","In Y.","I came back in almost 2 years to eat my favorite pasta, Rigatoni ""D"". The restaurant was fully packed on Sunday, and walk-in customers were asked to wait for at least 30 minutes to be seated. We were very glad that we made a reservation in advance via OpenTable app.
We got a booth table pretty quick and ordered a Rigatoni ""D"". They were running a special promotion - Choose a Specialty dish for today and any Classic for tomorrow. Throughout the promotion, we chose a Four-Cheese Ravioli.
It took more than 50 minutes to get the Rigatoni D. The server said there was a big party ahead of us which ended up causing significant delay on processing our order. It could have been better if the server informed us in a timely manner before I asked when my order would be served.
Pasta was rich and creamy - exactly what I wanted from the Rigatoni D. However, it is hard to say whether it was worth to wait about an hour to get that pasta. The four-cheese ravioli (frozen) for tomorrow was provided at the end when the check was given."

Two of us could only finish half of our meal and asked for it to take home. We were so looking forward to enjoying the rest of it later. As it turns out our dinners were accidentally sent home with someone else. But, it didn't end there with an ""Oh, sorry.""
As an apology the manager ordered two complete dishes to replace what we lost and gave it to us nicely wrapped in a container to take home! Seriously, how many restaurants would do that for their patrons. Good deeds need to be recognized."

I don't think the quality of food matches the high prices. It's good food but nothing out of this world. Honestly, I'd pick Olive Garden over this place.
We got free bread for the table which was nice. Still warm which is always a plus. I got clam chowder to start. I feel like I would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't lukewarm. It tasted like Chunky Campbell's clam chowder that I was too impatient to warm to a boil. Meh. For my entree I ordered the Lobster Carbonara. It was tasty but I was too full to enjoy it since it felt like we waited forever to get our food. It was a tad bit salty tbh but good overall. Glad I have a meal for lunch tomorrow.
The service was nice. Our waiter Mr. Flowers was attentive and accommodating with our large group. Thank you all the extra bread and iced tea refills. Also thanks for not making us feel rushed since we stayed past closing time. If anything I feel like we were in a rush to leave.
If there's a next time, I'd probably get the ""for two"" dinner option since it seems like the only option that's worth the money. But with the amount of great restaurants around the area, I can and have had better pasta dishes, or food in general, elsewhere."

The service was good, the wait for the food wasn't too long which is always nice!! Another thing I was very fond of is that they had everyone's food passed out around the same time, whereas other places do half the table than the other.
My friend I decided to do the meal for two: which was around 45$ including appetizer, pasta, pasta to-go, and dessert! For the price we got a lot of food and the quantity of each serving was more than enough! The overall quality of the food was tasty!!
And I wasn't aware that if you order a classic pasta you get the option to take one to-go which is super cool especially for families with kids!!
Also if you're wanting to come for an occasion we were allowed to bring our own cake and put on candles!
The overall experience was good, it was packed so it was a bit loud and crammed inside but despite that everything was good!

I often say you know how good the food will be by the bread they serve!!! We ordered the halibut Special of the day and the seafood linguine with marinara sauce ...both dishes were to die for!

Call me silly, but I love the starched tablecloths and napkins. I love the sweet, street-front locale. I love how the waiters seemed to actually pick up on when we were deep into a conversation and wait before dashing in with whatever ""special"" was oh-so important for us to know in exactly 12 minutes after we were seated.
It is the epitome of a lovely bistro. The Caprese salad was fabulous, topped only by the Stracciatella Alla Romana (an amazing soup, just saying).

Was a bit concerned ordering veal because it's often overcooked and can become tough very easily. But this was perfectly tender, juicy meat.

Otherwise there is pay parking right next to the restaurant, or the public parking garage near the library.
Staff was attentive and provided good service. We got the Caprese, bolognese, green pasta crepe with spinach, and a spicy penne pasta. For dessert we got the Tiramisu.
The Caprese was done very well. Ingredient was fresh and the dressing was excellent.
All of the pasta dishes were also done very well. They were all very delicious and it is hard to say which one I liked best. Note the Penne Aglico Olio E Spinaci is a tiny bit spicy, so might not be good for children.
Tiramisu was also very tasty and a good end to our lunch.

"Ristorante Paradiso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-paradiso-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Jen H.","Went on a date night here. Cute place with indoor and outdoor seating. Great wine list. We ordered a half bottle (cool that they have this option, although next time I'm ordering a full bottle) of Brunello di Montalcino. I highly recommend this wine. Don't let the rust color weird you out. The flavor is amazing- deep cherry flavors, medium to full bodied, and dry.
For dinner, I ordered the cioppino. I love seafood so it was an easy decision. The sauce had a strong garlic flavor and had a little heat to it. It came with fish, clams, mussels, and scallops & garlic toast points for dipping in the sauce.
My partner ordered the linguine with norcina (Italian sausage, cream sauce, black pepper, and parmasean). That was also very tasty and satisfying. If you love Alfredo, you will love this. The Italian sausage adds a nice spicy kick and fennel flavor.
Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner. Our server was very nice and informative. She informed us that our bottle of wine, when ordered as a full bottle, is not that much more (more value for your buck).
The only small criticism I have is that food was a bit slow to come out. The prices are a bit high (I guess I should expect this since it's in Kirkland) for staple Italian food."
"Ristorante Paradiso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-paradiso-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Assal M.","Maybe I'm giving it 3 stars because I had high expectations. The wine was good. The crostini ""welcome starter"" was delicious. We ordered the funghi pizza and spinach cannelloni. Meh. The pizza was just thicker than it should have been and a little too wet. Definitely not a success. The spinach cannelloni was good and the rose sauce was delicious but the overall dish was not amazing. The restaurant itself is quite cute but I wish the food was better."
"Ristorante Paradiso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-paradiso-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Philip S.","As I mentioned in the past, this wonderful Italian restaurant has never put me down. I was craving in the evening for a veal dish and I knew they had one on the menu... and I have to say, it was no disappointment. If your looking for a good quality veal dish, do yourself a favor and come to Paradise Restaurant and try their ""Scaloppine al Funghi"". A delicious thinly sliced veal with mushrooms in a white wine sauce. You have the option too with a side of mix veggies or pasta. The texture and taste of the overall veal was just right. Not overly salty or greasy but very smooth and juicy. You can taste everything that was infront of you. Once I was finished with the meal, I was completely satisfied. Thanks again guys, molto bene once again!!"

I got the tomato soup and the sausage pasta, the total was under $30! I didn't give this place a 5 star because the soup was mediocre. However the pasta tasted so fresh and rich! I can't wait to come back and try more dishes. Also they have indoor and patio seating. When the weather permits, patio is perfect :)"

The restaurant is very small and quaint but the food is excellent along with service. Drinks and wine are pretty tasty. We have never had a bad experience here.
Prices aren't too bad either. Just make sure you make reservations online otherwise you'll be waiting for awhile until a table opens up"
"Ristorante Paradiso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-paradiso-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Megan F.","We did not have a good, relaxing dinner here. I did like the dim lighting, though.
The atmosphere was so chaotic and obnoxious. Servers kept running behind our table to grab things and running back. I just could not relax in this environment.
Our server was rude and did not even attempt to engage with us. I only liked the young bus boys who appeared to be teenagers. They were hustling HARD and the only kind souls who cared. I feel bad that they are probably so underpaid when they are doing more work than our lazy server who could care less about us. My additional star is for them!
The gorgonzola fettuccine with chicken was so salty and the sauce was way too rich. I could only handle a few bites before asking for a to-go box. I honestly prefer Olive Garden over Ristorante Paradiso."
"Ristorante Paradiso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-paradiso-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Lena S.","We decided to try this place on Valentines Day for the first time as we were craving Italian food and have walked past this place a million times. We had a reservation for 7 pm, but as we entered we saw a crowd of people waiting at the front door and once we checked in, they told us they are running about 30 min behind schedule...yikes...not something you want to hear, but it was a very busy night for restaurants in the area so we weren't too mad, plus they had a great attitude about it and were very apologetic.
We got seated and a bread basket was placed on our table with some butter which I have to say was THE BEST free bread I have ever gotten at a restaurant. It came right out of the oven, still super hot and crunchy, but fluffy on the inside. I ate way more bread than I should have. We ordered the Antipasto All'Italiana meat, cheese, and marinated veggie platter which I liked, but I thought could have been presented in a more elegant manner. I also ordered the lobster tortellini which was very delicious, cooked well, and had a wonderful cream sauce...although it was a bit pricey. There were 5 pieces of tortellini and the dish cost $28 dollars. For dessert, we ordered the sour cream cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was SO good, it tasted like it was home made and the raspberry sauce was so fresh and delicious.
The restaurant itself has a great vibe. It is on the small side, but feels very cozy and intimate. It really reminds me of a restaurant you would find in Italy.
Overall, once our waitress got to our table she was very friendly, got our food out to us quickly, and was very lovely to us despite how incredibly busy they were. Although there was a bumpy start at the beginning, in the end I felt that his restaurant did a great job with food and service. I am excited to come back here for a future meal when it is not so busy!"
"Ristorante Paradiso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-paradiso-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Huong L.","Was in the Kirkland area and decided to try this place for dinner and thought it was just ok.
Service was good, they were attentive with refilling our water and bread and made sure everything was good.
Food wise, I definitely had better. We had the following:
Bread: probably the best thing we had, it was soft, warm and light. We had two servings of these because its so good, went well with the butter as well as the sauce from the pasta dish.
Antipasto all'italliana: few slices of different deli meats, a couple slices of provolone cheese and some grilled veggies - $15. I thought it was just ok, standard charcuterie plate, a little pricey but nothing was bad.
Linguine Tutto mare: pasta with mixed seafood of clams, mussels, prawns and scallops in marinara sauce -$22. The pasta was not Al dente yet, still kind of on the firmer side. Some of the seafood was still Sandy and gritty so they didn't clean it well. Finally, the sauce was on the bland side.
Overall, it was ok, definitely need some improvement, except for the bread. It is on the pricier side as well, so a good place to try, but not my cup of tea."

We both started with the mussels and clams (cooked to perfection and lightly flavored broth) and then had the cioppino for our entrees (in the future I would order the greens for the appetizer as the cioppino has plenty of clams and mussels to satisfy your craving for shellfish!) I also had some table bread (ciabatta) with butter before dinner was served and next time I would avoid that as I was pretty stuffed after the appetizers arrived. The cioppino was very flavorful and I liked that they used white wine in their recipe, as it was different than my favorite cioppino that is made with red wine. The recipe here is just as good if not better! You know it's good when they are able to make Atlantic salmon taste like coho!
For dessert we had the Panna Cotta (perfection) and the tiramisu (fresh, dense, delicious). We ended up taking most of the tiramisu home and enjoyed it today for lunch - just as good on day 2!"
"Coltiva: Pizzeria e Barra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/coltiva-pizzeria-e-barra-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lindsay C.","I have been wanting to try this spot, but let's be honest: I'm fiercely loyal to a few other pizza places nearby. A dear friend is a big fan, though, so on New Years we decided to give it a try.
We called for a reservation (highly recommend this on a busy night -- the place is tiny!) and were warmly greeted by our server / the bartender, who apologized for a short wait. When we asked about wines and told her the types of wines we like, she gladly pointed out their extensive selection of natural and raw wines, and made a recommendation. At $48, the one we tried was *outstanding* -- and affordable. We were blown away.
The appetizer we had was good, not great (the brussels sprouts -- probably because we had the pancetta on the side, for the vegetarians in the group), but the pizzas did not disappoint. We shared three pies: a regular margherita; the squash with burrata; and the funghi. I was once told you could judge the quality of a pizza place by the margherita, since you can tell the freshness of the ingredients. Holy cow, this one was stellar. It also comes out with a ramekin of fresh salt and spices, both of which enhance the flavors. The burrata pie is served hot with a massive dollop of cold burrata in the middle. The melding of flavors and temperatures was so unexpected -- and delicious.
I am a fan of this spot and can't wait to return."

I only wish the place was a tad bigger as it's not good for large groups. Great prices, great people (seriously, meet the owners), and fantastic food!
Everything is so fresh and delicious. The kale and burrata pizza is to die for. There's seriously something mystifying that makes me salivate every time I think about it. Not only that, but the Margherita pizza is one of the best around. Margherita pizzas are usually so basic, but they've really elevated this to another level.
My only complaint is that they need to step up their cocktail game. Pro tip: don't order a French 75 here."

The prices are a bit high, but the quality matches it- I went for HH so I could savor their pizza for a bit less than the regular price- the crust is delicious and the toppings are clearly of the highest quality. Also, the cocktail was strong.
Their kale/squash pizza was amazing. Next time I want to celebrate and spend a little extra- I'm coming here for pizzas!"

This is literally in the middle of the residential buildings at queen Anne, and a block way from Buckleys. The outdoor seating of the place is very inviting and I was curious to try some beer and pizza on a nice summer day. The service and ambience were spot on. The good part is that the place doesn't get too crowded and it's easy to get a table outside even during busy times.
With all that, the food was the biggest disappointment for me. The pizza lacked flavor and crust was too thin. We had ordered the margarita and marinara pizza. The beer was served in wine glasses . I'll pass on this place only coz of the food."
"Coltiva: Pizzeria e Barra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/coltiva-pizzeria-e-barra-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tiffany J.","I recently came here for a Yelp Elite event and everything was fantastic. We were able to try two different wines which both were great with flavor. We were also able to try a cheese spread laid out with heirloom tomatoes and balsamic drizzle. Now the showstopper obviously were the two different pizzas we got to try. The Delux was my personal favorite. It came with sun dried tomatoes, pepperoni, sausage and goat cheese. Yum. The Burrata was also very tasty. It included a squash base with Kale, olive oil, sea salt, and burrata. Very different and unique but really quite tasty. Last but not least for dessert we were offered Tiramisu which was delicious! It had a very strong coffee flavor which I loved. This is solely a pizza and salad place so don't expect anything else. The pizza is on the smaller side for me (I could probably eat a whole one myself) but tasty.
I love the interior and the atmosphere of this place. It is a very tiny place though, there is no way you can fit more then 30 people in the restaurant but it has a very nice intimate vibe. Love all of the natural lighting and in the summer there is an option to slide open the front window to get a breeze and sit outside in the patio. The staff and owner were so pleasant I definitely would come back here again. Prices are a little toward the higher side but you're paying for the experience and the experience was out of this world. I definitely recommend for a date night or intimate gathering with a few close friends."
"Coltiva: Pizzeria e Barra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/coltiva-pizzeria-e-barra-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ly T.","Meh at most. Anything special... naw. $18-$22 personal sized pizzas. (I could have taken down 2 of them)
I would have given it a better review only if they gave me extra pepperoni as I asked. When it was brought out; the server came by and took it back to the cook because it didn't look like there was much. The cook was adamant that it is extra... hate to see what the normal one looks like. O'wait... the lady next to me had a normal one. Looked like mine. FML. (Please look at my photo and tell me this place is not skimping on toppings... especially if they upcharge for EXTRA!)

"Coltiva: Pizzeria e Barra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/coltiva-pizzeria-e-barra-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rishabh J.","Came here for a Yelp event, and loved it!
Quality: The food is top notch. I had a Caprese Plate (not sure what it is officially called, but it has cheese, basil, and tomatoes) and a Kale and Squash Pizza. The Caprese Plate had fresh cheese that was unique and perfectly dressed with basalmic. The pizza was my favorite part, mostly because it is something I would have never ordered otherwise. Squash and kale sound awful on a pizza, but it was actually really good. The sweetness of squash balanced the bitterness of the kale perfectly. The crust was perfectly cooked and crunchy. I had the tiramisu, which was good too.
Quantity: Smaller plates, which is expected for a nice restaurant. The pizza can feed 1 if you are hungry, or 2 if neither one of you is really hungry.
Price: Apparently their happy hour pizza is only $10, which is pretty good.
Service: The owner was super nice and explained where everything was sourced from and why he chose it. The manager was super attentive and the staff seemed very knowledgeable.
Overall, this might be my new favorite happy hour spot."

This place is very cute inside and I love the decor. As for seating, it is extremely intimate with the tables being very close and minimal walking space.
We decided to share our food among a group of 4 and feel that we definitely got the right amount of food. We ordered a salad called ""Little Gem"" and it tasted similar to a Caesar salad, which I thought was very good and fresh tasting.
We ordered their meat charcuterie plate and I thought it was just okay. The meat is not of great quality compared to many other places in Seattle.
For pizza, we ordered the ""Piccante"" pizza, which comes with Italian salami, peppers, and mozzarella. I thought this pizza was just okay, it was too salty for my taste. We also ordered their Funghi pizza, which I liked much better. It came with olive oil and mushrooms. I thought this pizza had more flavor.

It's not like they were slammed.
What really bugs me, the waitress came by twice to how things are going, but never once said anything about my salad.
The couple in front of me got their order pizza and arugula salad within a reasonable time and we were there pretty much there at the same time and ordered within seconds apart. WTF! I finally got frustrated and ask to be cashed out my $6.61 glass of wine and left her a $2 tip.
I'm a pretty good good tipper, but they/she was not worthy of more.

It is a couple blocks off the main drag in Lower Queen Anne which makes parking significantly less painful. There are several cute outdoor tables and then of course tables inside - but only 8 or so. There is also a bar that can seat probably 6 people. The bar and inside is lovely! The owner and staff were very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. We had three cheeses - all of which were very nice. We also had La Bianca cocktail - which normally I don't love rum drinks - but it was very good - not too sweet or too bitter. I only tried one of the pizzas - the burrata - but that was only because I had like 3 pieces of it. It was so unique and delicious! I had never seen squash on a pizza and was skeptical but it won me over. The burrata on the pizza was also a generous portion. I for sure want this pizza again in the near future! I also really loved the wines I had here - especially the Calcarius Rossopuglia - a greater lighter red for the summer :) Highly recommend trying this out!!"

We really wanted to like this place, but it was absolutely sub par. The server was zombie-esque. Pizza was just OK, barely any flavor. The crust was pretty good, a bit on the chewy side though.
They have 2 beers on tap, both served in wine glasses. So more like 8oz.
The tables were really small and the ambiance was lacking some. Would have liked a little more space in between tables and the lights more on the dimmer side.

"Coltiva: Pizzeria e Barra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/coltiva-pizzeria-e-barra-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan M.","Wonderful casual but nice place with very tasty pizzas, salads and wine!
So far they have not even been open a week but the menu is impressive, everyone is kind and courteous and knowledgeable and the food tastes delicious!
The ambience is the perfect combination between casual and classy. They have a good variety of food without the menu getting too big and cumbersome and their wine selection is varied and pairs perfect with the food! Even pistachio gelato along with a lime sorbet were dessert options!
Critiques/Suggestions:
While I can't criticize at all there are couple things that would be great to see! Perhaps if they do well early on they can add some of these things in the future.
- Lunch grab & go half-pizzas & salad combo
- Stronger local wine selection that pairs well with Italian Cuisine (Brian Carter's Tuttorosso, Five Star Cellars' Sangiovese, Fidelitas' Malbec, Merlot or Cab etc...)
Again, the above are merely some suggestions off the top of my head; none of them are expert business decisions nor are they meant to be any criticism. I'll definitely be back and am looking forward to it already! Living a block away helps too of course!"

This once-respected establishment has cratered under new management:
* rancid olive oil served with bread
* halibut obviously defrosted, came out looking like a cheetah had gnawed on it and discarded it (also: it was sitting in a half centimeter of flavorless oil - HARDLY the promised ""cognac reduction""
* lasagna was a watery soup
* plates were searingly hot yet pasta was somehow cold?
The charming and polite waitress would have been a lone ""pro"" except she described all of our dishes inaccurately and only carried one plate at a time. It took four trips back to the kitchen to bring out our two entrees and sides.
However I must admit a debt of gratitude to this restaurant. Their high-fat and rancid food made me feel so ill that I went to the emergency room later that night, where they discovered I needed an emergency gall bladder removal. Thank you Bistro
Baffi!"
"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Amandeep S.","I don't give out 1-2 ratings lightly. But I really do feel compelled to give this place that after my experience on Friday.
My husband and I came for dinner around 8:40pm. It wasn't really busy at the time, we probably missed the dinner rush; only about 3 other tables had people at them. We were seated quickly in the more quiet area to the right. The ambiance was super nice, with a little fake fireplace and it definitely has a romantic feel to it. One problem here though: it was too dark, we could barely read our menus.
Our server didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes after we sat down, and forgot to give us water, so we had to ask for it. There were quite a few things she missed that night but she was actually new so it wasn't all her fault - she was really nice and friendly!
But here were the main problems:
1) Our food took about 35-40 min to come out. It was nearly 9:30pm by the time we received it. I ordered the lobster ravioli and my husband ordered the carbonara (it wasn't on the menu but since he saw it in other yelp photos/reviews, he asked the server and she found out that it was something that could be ordered)
2) when the food did come out, both my husband's spaghetti noodles and my ravioli were not cooked all the way. I love Italian food and know that it's supposed to be ""al dente"", but our food wasn't al dente at all. I know we probably should have said something to the server but given that the food took so long in the first place and the restaurant was closing soon, we didn't wanna do that.
3) my dish was EXTREMELY SALTY! Yes it was good, but the more I ate, I realized how salty it was - my mouth and my throat actually felt like they were burning and I drank multiple glasses of water (including when I got home)
4) both mine and my husband's stomachs started hurting when we arrived back home that night. Not sure if it's because the pasta dough wasn't cooked all the way or what, but we were in pain. Luckily we didn't have to vomit but it felt pretty close to it.
5) I checked in to restaurant so we received a free tiramisu slice, which was cool - but it was a really small slice! I don't think I've been served this small of a slice before anywhere; and the price for this is $8 according to the menu, so for that price, I don't think it's worth it.
6) the price for what we ate drank didn't seem to be worth it in my opinion - we paid about $80, for two glasses of wine and two entrees (which includes tax and tip).
Our highlight of the night was actually the bread we received - focaccia bread with balsamic vinegar, olive oil and parsley (could have used more of this mix though because we ended up with more bread!). It was delicious!
I'm disappointed in our experience as most previous reviews were very positive, and probably won't be back."

"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Daniel B.","First, the only reason for the four-star rating was the price. I had a ""32 ounce Tomahawk Ribeye"" with a price of $129. Now, I would have happily paid that had there been more than 16 ounces of meat, but there was so much fat that I got maybe 8-10 ounces. This was a disappointment.
That said, the rest of the meal was great. The food was cooked superbly and the wine selection was so diverse that anything on he menu could be paired accordingly.
The server (young man with a beard and a great personality-reminiscent of Seth Rogen) was excellent! He was not short on knowledge (except for being able to explain the difference between ice cream and gellato).
Tucked into a residential strip mall, the outside of the restaurant leaves much to be desired. However, the decor inside paints a picture of a typical New York Italian bistro, transplanted in the Pacific Northwest.
I had the Tiramisu for dessert while my friend had the flourless chocolate-walnut cake. Both were home-runs! Hat's off to the chef that made these!
I'd come back, with the goal of trying their lobster ravioli.
My suggestion to the owner is to re-evaluate some (not all) prices, such as the Tomahawk, and your rating will increase.
Lastly, my compliments to the chefs. They got their acts together!"

I randomly found it here on yelp, saw a picture of the tomahawk steak and had to try it. When we got to the restaurant, it was in such a weird spot but I'm glad we decided to give it a go anyways! We went for dinner on a Friday night. It wasn't too busy, our waitress was great and very informative. The food was absolutely amazing! We got the tomahawk steak ( obviously) it came with a side of pasta which was sooooo good and creamy! We also had the seafood spaghetti which I forgot the name but that was also so good!!! Definitely Recommend!"
"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Susie D.","I was so disappointed by this restaurant. It was recommended by a friend and seeing the reviews I really thought it would be good. Apparently there is new ownership and it must be dramatically different than before because this is waaaaayyy over priced for what you get.
First off they didn't have any of the wine bottles that were listed in the menu. The waiter had to search all over for each one we asked for. He instead came back with an $80 bottle Syrah (that was marked up by $50). The waiter told us he would get us a deal on the wine but never did so. And he kept topping off our wine, who does that??
The service was fine, but the food was so mediocre. Way too much vinegar in the salad dressing, the bruschetta was bland. Our main courses were just odd. They were served on scalding hot plates so that the sauce on my pork chop was boiling. My husband had the most flavorless filet mignon. It was just such a disappointment. In the end we couldn't believe that we paid almost $200 for it all."

"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Wen W.","I've been in Burien for about 8 years, and I can't believe I let this little tucked-away restaurant get away from my sight all these times! Bistro Baffi is what you would consider a little local authentic Italian restaurant with intimate and romantic vibe if you ever want to have a peaceful evening out in Burien and want to avoid the city hassle.
When we first came in, the head chef waved at us to say hi. That is what I loved: The friendly and intimate vibe you'd get from a small local restaurant. We were seated right away despite with our reservation. I think it was a Friday night, so the restaurant wasn't crazily busy just yet. There was candle lit for our table, so that was neat. We didn't order drinks and heavy appetizer. We simply started out with salad and went straight for seafood and pasta for entrees. The food was excellent with fresh wild-caught prawns and scallops. The pasta dishes were served with light creamy sauce, so that went easy in my stomach since I don't do well with dairy products.
The waitress knew what she was doing when presenting to us the specials of the day. It was like she memorized the speech at the back of her head, or it's just that she really enjoyed talking about the fresh seafood of the day. Either way, I'd take that over listening to a waitress who would stumble and not know what to say about a product.
We will definitely come back to this restaurant!"

"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Peter N.","My brother and I had some strong cravings for Italian, so we decided to pull into this restaurant for dinner.
As soon as we entered the front doors, we could see the chefs whipping meals together right behind the front counter - I thought that was kinda neat. We were seated immediately and served water along with the menus.
I ordered the Alfredo Peppardelle and my brother got the Lamb-chops. When our food arrived, I thought the portion sizes were decent. The first bite made me grin from ear to ear! It was creamy and full of flavor. I loved it! I hate to admit this, but halfway through my meal, I was getting a bit tired of the flavor. It's not a flavor I can constantly eat for an entire meal.
Prices were also on the higher end. The two orders came out to about $80 for the both of us. That would have to be the biggest downfall for me since I know there are so many other options out there that come at a more reasonable price."

Having been my first visit, next time, and my recommendation, I think ordering dishes the table is interested in and taking bites of each would be best. The dishes we had were so good! Started with the focaccia bread (baked in house) of course with the clams Rockefeller (Rich, creamy and cheesy). For our entrees we have the pappardelle with mushroom/ truffle (so rich and sooo good, but hard to finish), the penne alla mike (lighter/spicy pink sauce with shrimp), and the lobster ravioli (richer pink sauce with great bites of lobster and veggies inside). We don't frequent Burien often but now have a new reason to return. The staff (Carmen) were fabulously friendly including the chef who greeted us upon arrival. The atmosphere is quaint and romantic."

"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Nancy W.","I'm sorry you feel this way because much of what you're saying is inaccurate. I called and talked to the manager once. It was an uphill battle the whole conversation and never once did he agree to take responsibility for mistakes that were made. He indicated he would contact me with a resolution and that never happened. I never asked for free food for two persons. I was the one whose dish was incorrect and you made it again and also gave me a portion to take home. What I took home was still not correct. It was my mistake in saying that the freshwater prawns were lobsters. That said, it doesn't take away the fact that one of them was half again the size as the other and if you have two people sitting next to one another ordering the same dish, it's rather awkward. Also, I didn't have a special request with my pasta dish, rather I substituted the penne with linguine because I don't care for thick pasta. It shouldn't have affected how you made the dish. Lastly, I never asked you to have Michael stay or run the business. I simply stated that when he ""was"" running the business it was much more hands on, he cared more about the quality of food, the presentation and would actually come out and talk to the customers at their table. I maintain my review and I'm only sorry that you cannot be accurate about yours..."
"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Matt R.","Had heard great things about this place but it was just ok. Everything seems to come with a tomato cream sauce which is not very memorable. Saltimbocca sauce was watery, ravioli was not bad. Risotto was no true risotto as it was made with that pink tomato cream. Authentic risotto does not have a sauce, the creaminess should come from stirring the rice while it cooks. Caprese salad had hard ice cold tomatoes. Would have been better if they were room temp. Definitely not authentic Italian but had good service in a nice atmosphere. Probably won't go back."

Our server (I think her name was Rachel) was wonderful and made some great suggestions, since we were ""newbies"". We loved the stuffed mushroom appetizers, and the bruschetta was phenomenal! The bread was perfectly grilled and was not at all crunchy and hard. The tomato, mozzarella, and prosciutto topping was perfect. (The prosciutto was not on the menu, but Rachel said they were offering it that night as a special.)
We had the Ravioli D'Aragosta, Spaghetti Pescatore, and a Scallops dish for our main courses. Wonderful!
We had no room for dessert, but that didn't keep a couple of us from sharing the fabulous tiramisu - the best I have ever had.
We all agreed that we will be returning to Bistro Baffi again."

Even better was the freshness of the fish - they bring table side the fresh fish of the day and tell you how it is prepared. Many of us had the Pasta di' Mare - which was delicious. Hard to imagine but we finished with some desserts - the limoncello sorbet was perfect!

They have a large menu of pizza, pasta, salad, and all things delicious. We came in with quite a large group (12+) and were seated fairly quickly at ~6pm on a Thursday. It was a game night too, so most people were watching the one TV in the bar side of the place.
The pizza was really good. I am notorious for not eating my crust and ate most of the crust on the three slices I had. We got two very large pizzas for the table, a caprese salad as a starter, and then a couple people got their own thing. These pizzas are no joke. They are quite large, fully loaded with the toppings you order, and taste delicious. The caprese salad also tasted really fresh! I could not get enough of everything, including the tomatoes!
Super satisfied customer here. Service was a bit slow and it took a while to get a second round of drinks, but I truly enjoyed eating here and recommend it for large groups."

We actually came here for his birthday, and sat on the bar side of the restaurant.
As for the food, we ordered their meat combo and oyster pizza; Yes oysters! We had to try it, and I was skeptical.
First off the meat combo...it was great, there was a ton of cheese and a well balance of meat along with mushrooms. I thought the crust was crisp and overall there was some really nice flavor.
Now with the oyster...hmm, well it was good! They didn't put a lot of oysters, and they were chopped into smaller pieces, so overall not a big seafood flavor which I liked for a pizza. Overall very similar in build to the combo and nice to try. I prob would not order again, as I'm more of a traditional meat pizza.
As for the bar, I'm not sure if they are owned together or just partnered. I ordered an old fashion, and it was good but not great. I should have specified my liquor of choice, so I'm not sure what it was made with, though it seemed a bit watery and lacking in flavor.
I'd def come back here in the future!"

The pasta is like cheesy, saucy, and HUGE portions. It's not fancy or anything, but it's great. It's attached to Harry's Bar or whatever so they have late night food all week. My go to options is the baked lasagna, greek pasta, and the chicken parm. Like I said the portions are huge and come with either soup or salad and garlic bread.
The service has been really great and they've always been accommodating to special requests. Parking in the area isn't great, but can be found!"
"Olympia Pizza and Spaghetti House III","https://www.yelp.com/biz/olympia-pizza-and-spaghetti-house-iii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wendy L.","Went here because they offer a gluten free crust option which is great because not everyone does! But they didn't have a nondairy cheese option, so I wasn't able to order pizza which I'd been craving b/c I'm no-dairy/vegan. They could widen their customer base if they just offered one nondairy option for all the lactose intolerant and vegan people. But my friend had one of their regular dairy veggie pizzas and thought it was pretty good. A nice thick crust on it, looked loaded and perfectly cooked to me.
I personally liked the atmosphere. There were plenty of comfortable booths and the place was painted and decorated thoughtfully in unique classy colors with interesting wall art, giving it a sort of antique Romanesque feel--not your average pizza joint slapped together. It's connected to Harry's Bar inside, where you can walk back and forth between the two, and the bar is classy too. A soothing place with AC in hot summer in this mainly old non-AC area of town. And--if you happen to like being hot in summer, hey there's outdoor seating where you can roast away!
The pizza was ready exactly on time when we called ahead, served by a super friendly guy with a smile and a great sense of humor. This was during non-peak hours, so maybe that helped. But I've been to plenty of places where hey, it doesn't matter WHAT time of day it is--you still ain't getting any kind of good service, Pal! This is not one of those places, thank goodness!"

We spotted this gem and decided to give it a try. First thing we noticed, the Excellent food rating on the door...my husband loves this! Before Washington started this law, he visited New York, where this was ALREADY law and loved seeing the ratings on the door...made it easy to choose which ones to go into and which ones to avoid! Wasn't busy at all, they had just opened up, so we had our pick of the litter. Choose a booth by the window! Restaurant is very clean, not run down, but not brand new, but had a ""homey"" feel to it! We were welcomed by a very nice lady that had a very thick Greek accent! I ordered the manicotti with meat sauce, & a salad, hubs had the chicken parmesan sandwich with a cup of soup!
We get our order, my husband takes a bite looks at me, closes his eyes and says ""don't talk to me for a minute""....I know what that means! he said it was one of IF NOT the best sandwiches he has ever had! Chicken was seasoned perfectly, good sauce, but it was the bread that did it...lightly toasted inside and nice a spongy soft on the outside, but not soggy...HE LOVED IT !!
My manicotti was great, cheese was flavored good (some restaurants the ricotta is just bland, not this case) Piping hot and delicious! My salad was awesome as well...crisp lettuce with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives with mozzarella cheese and tons of blue cheese dressing!
Bill was completely reasonable, we walked out of there under $50 with tax and tip! We live about a half hour away, but we will be back!!!"

The food is good and we really like the server Austin. He remembers what we typically order and is always friendly.
The salads are really good and the half size is more than enough for one or even two. My favorite is the Greek salad. The Tortellini is yummy, filling and rich in flavor.
I recently tried the chicken parmesan and wasn't all that impressed. The portion was large and it looked great. I'm told by my co-worker that it must have been an off day because it's usually a lot better. He got it too. The chicken was tough and had some gristle throughout. The meat was lukewarm too, as if it had been taken out of the fridge prior to warming it up and serving it on top of the spaghetti.
We all love the garlic bread. The mizithra spaghetti is delicious with loads of garlic.
My favorite pasta dish here is the totellini (3-cheese)."

Both were hungry and was craving for some pizza and pasta.
Saw this joint on the maps and it had good ratings. So we went down and gave it shot.
So we walked in and waited for the host to be seated.
We sat down and was checking out the menu, the prices are unbelievably high. Now I live in Los Angeles and prices are not even that high for pizza or pasta, unless it's a fancy restaurant. But even tho, it wasn't that expensive.
But if it's an expensive place it better be worth it. But nope!!
Ordered a pesto chicken fettuccine.
This pasta was drench in a watery pesto sauce.
It was basically like im eating fucking ramen noodles with green food coloring soup.
It had :
No Flavor
Not enough cheese
Pasta was hard
And there chicken was watery and felt expired!!!!!
I myself had to add allot of parmesan and chili peppers for it to taste better. But the watery sauce was taking out the flavor.
But no way I couldn't waste it. I finished my damn food ""ONLY CAUSE I DID NOT WANNA WASTE $20 ON A FUCKING PASTA !

That said, this place's pizza was among the worst pizza I've EVER had. I'm including frozen pizza and elementary school lunch pizza. The cheese was like mayonnaise (or maybe alfredo sauce?) baked at a high enough heat to create a thin brown crust. I don't remember the crust or sauce -- maybe it was fine -- but the cheese was so bad I thought I was being pranked. Look at other people's pictures (accompanying good reviews)--the pizza looks nasty! They have a lot of good reviews so obviously some people are fans, but I honestly don't get it."

Go Saturday for lunch, and if u don't have a great time I will pay for dinner plus your tattoo.
Cons: Evening time is a whole different story but I believe it starts with the owner as she sets the tone. For reg customers she appears standoffish unless you are gay and she got out of her comfort zone to know you. She is your typical Seattle freeze Capital Hill style, exhausted,and needs to retire. She sets the tone for the rest of her staff, most of which leave for a better working environment. I'm not surprised. She can be friendly but only to large group$ but to the the rest you are scum. Again please see my comments about bartender John. As for the other bartenders particularly at night, some are socially awkward, just don't care, and others should focus on than their job instead of their hair, flirting with girls, and try to be cooler than you.
The quality of the food at night is rushed as well, attention to detail is lacking as well as pizzas ordered for here came in a box. Again see John in the afternoon.
Because the core issue lies with the owner she will NOT be the change you seek.

When we got the bruschetta with mushrooms, first I thought it looked like dessert. But -oh-my-God what an amazing mixture of flavors and unbelievably scrumptious. I was genuinely surprised.
Seafood paella is on a pricey side, but no wonder, they took all the Finding Nemo characters and smothered them in saffron rice. Calamari, shrimp, salmon, octopus, 2 types of mussels, Italian sausage and chicken!! No, not chicken of the sea, the bawk bawk kind.
Absolutely lovely place downtown Renton.
Pros:
-Delicious food
- Excellent service (what a character Cristian has, I have no idea how he keeps it up entire evening, great work!)
- Romantic and inviting ambiance

We were entertained by our server who was a charming man with large gestures and a fun attitude. He was a nice distraction from the long wait we had between ordering drinks and again when we waited to be served our entrees.
The highlights were the dishes at a reasonable price except for the specials. Fried calamari starter was excellent as was the Caesar salad. I really enjoyed the linguini vongole, a good portion of clams in a tasty garlic butter sauce. My friend enjoyed the giant serving of seafood paella customized to her liking. For dessert would recommend the spumoni gelato or tiramisu. Excellent flavor!
The lowlights were the spaghetti carbonara. Having had this dish in Italy I can say there was not enough creamy egg yolk. It was dry and the only saving grace was the generous amount of pancetta in it. The chocolate fudge cake was extremely rich and not a hit with everyone that tried it. Don't let them try to tell you otherwise. Lastly their wine list is expensive! Local wines will set you back $40 at a minimum.

Wine- Chianti Classico & Cab were bold and yummy
Appetizer- ordered truffle fries, they serve you a lot of fries, fresh, crispy, and delicious
Mains- had the lobster spaghetti special which was very flavorful with a spicy kick, delicious // also ordered the 16oz ribeye (medium) and was a little on the greasy side but very good
Dessert - coppa pistachio which is a gelato dessert in a glass with chocolate drizzle on the plate, also very delicious"
"Marianna Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/marianna-ristorante-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Krista T.","Meh. It was okay.
Gotta give credit where it's due - the prices are very reasonable and the staff is very nice.
Overall, I thought the food was just average, but perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes.
The Good: The bellini and the parmesan truffle fries. (How can you go wrong with truffle fries? yum!)
The Okay: The chopped salad was okay. It barely had any chickpeas or salami, so it felt like I was just eating the greens. Vinaigrette was good though.
The Bad: When going to an italian restaurant for the first time, I almost always order the lasagna because it's a basic italian dish that most restaurants can get right. For me, though, Marianna did not get this right. It was very basic with not many flavors. It honestly looked and tasted as if Chef Boyardee himself was in the back putting this dish together.
This was a forgettable meal, but I might be back at a later date to give it another try since I'm trying to support local Renton businesses. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again though."
"Marianna Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/marianna-ristorante-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Mariah J.","I'm sorry, this lasagna isn't ok. The pasta is over cooked fork couldn't even grip it. Barely any meat. Too much cheese. No structure and very loose. This wasn't baked, for sure microwaved this.
I just moved to the area and this was my first time trying this restaurant because my granny wanted it. She usually gets the spaghetti and meatballs but she wanted to get a lasagna with me. Both of us didn't like it. The reason why it's a 2 star instead on 1 is because of the guy with the loud voice and funny personality that greeted me, his personality alone made me want to eat inside instead of pick up. I hope other items on your menu is better. Maybe next time."

I was surprised at some of the reviews because the meal I had was excellent and was a really good price. Service was great as well.
They have some nice wine choices, I had a good glass of red. The bread they provide was good also.
I ordered one of the specials, the paella. This came with an incredible amount of delicious seafood--it could easily have fed two. There was a full piece of salmon that was perfectly cooked. There were a few crab legs that were nice and fresh. The shrimp were nice and large. Then there was also lots of mussels and clams along with calamari. Naturally the rice tasted wonderful with all of that fish included. It was a really incredible dish--I am not sure how often it is on the special list, but worth getting."

We started with the Calamari with the aioli and let me tell you something, that aioli is outstanding. We also got the Paella and it was phenomenal. Filled with calamari, muscles, clam, shrimp, salmon, sausage and yes rice!! By this time we were to full for dessert but ordered anyway. To go of course. Not really a place for ourr 5 year old but may take him when he is older as he loves noodles. The waiter was amazing and friendly.

To make sure the kids won't bother anyone else, I asked my wife to keep them outside, while I went in to get food. I have a coupon from the entertainment book, and I was informed that it they will not honor it unless we dine inside. I let the front desk person know, the coupon didn't say we have to dine in.

The pizza is the best & such a great value. Their special of the day offer the best fancier fare. I had the boneless ribeye steak, which was probably comparable to one of best steak I've ever had in Florence so it's very good. Their chicken with gorgonzola is addictive & flavorful. Just have to empathize that all their pizzas are awesome!"
"Marianna Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/marianna-ristorante-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Violet S.","We were a family of 3 adults who came in around 4:45 pm Monday to celebrate a birthday.
Amazingly enough, everything we ordered was really tasty.
The calamari was just a little too greasy, but had great flavor and texture. I really loved the green aioli sauce that came with it. Even the complimentary bread was nice, and went well with the olive oil herb mixture.
For entrees, we got the lobster Ravioli Aurora, King Salmon Piccata special, and the spaghetti carbonara. For drinks, we had the Bella Donna. Each entree was actually delicious. My favorite was the huge portion of spaghetti carbonara. It was heavy with cream, and had a good portion of pancetta.
For dessert, we ordered tiramisu. The cake had some liqueur in it, but neither the alcohol nor the cream was overpowering. It was really well balanced.
We only had one issue; although delicious, the king salmon was undercooked. I'm sure the cook would have made it right if we had pointed it out to the waitress, but we just decided to take it to go and cook it more at home.
I'm giving 5 stars for the quality of food and for the fact that our waitress gave us a free birthday dessert and also honored the yelp check-in coupon for $10 off. It was really great service."

"Marianna Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/marianna-ristorante-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Adam O.","Don't usually bother to write bad reviews but this is an exception. Back on Valentine's day I got a rock about two inches around served in my very expensive seafood dish. Made server aware of it, and they acted like it was no big deal. ""Oh that happens sometimes."" Fortunate for all parties concerned I didn't bite down on it. Food was ok. Didn't make a fuss because it's Valentine's and didn't want to ruin the mood.
Fast forward last week, go to the bar, order a dirty martini. Served with no olive juice. Asked why. They were out. How are you going to serve a drink without all the ingredients? And you knew you were out. Was then charged $14 for the one drink. Between the two that's enough for me not to go back and post this as a warning to would be restaurant goers.

"Fitchi House","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fitchi-house-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katrina P.","We had a great experience at Fitchi House!
The owner is from Turkmenistan and a Fitchi is a traditional dish. It is like a pot pie crust and inside is a ground beef and onion filling. She gave us a banana pepper infused vinegar to add to it. I enjoyed it, but the hubby didn't.
The pizza was super good. The crust was tasty and not too thick. The toppings were fresh. We had chicken with Alfredo sauce and the chicken club. I would recommend both, but definitely try the chicken club. I haven't seen it at other places, but it is tasty!
I didn't look for a parking lot since there was easy street parking available as it was late night. The place is clean. Food is halal and yummy. It was a win!"

"Fitchi House","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fitchi-house-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nicole Y.","What a pleasant surprise. I tried the Fitchi and it was even more heavenly than it looked. I'm not sure how they made this simple meat pie taste so good but it was fire. The pastry was light, flaky and browned on the outside, buttery and moist on the inside. It was almost like a soup dumpling in the sense that once you bit into it, there was just enough broth on the inside, along with the meat, to be quite delightful. I ordered this delivery so I can't speak to the service or environment but their delivery packaging was great. It's always a plus when your delivery doesn't arrive in a soggy bag dripping with what ever your ordered which sadly happens quite often from a lot of places. They are also open late which is always great! I'm excited to come back and try more from the menu. What a gem of a restaurant!"

I ordered a fitchi and somsa, I would have appreciated if owner had told me they were almost the same thing but with different shape, because they tasted the same . At first it looked good, then I opened and a lot of liquid came through it seems the filling was freezed or something. Bottom of the pastry was so soogy and almost raw dough in the bottom. No flavor at all. Really disappointed because the place is clean and it seems new and the owner has the best service ever."
"Fitchi House","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fitchi-house-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tom M.","I'm a big fan of Central Asian culture, including its food, which in my experience falls more on the ""comfort food"" side of the spectrum that I inhabit than haute cuisine.
Despite being the center of the universe in the 15th century, the region is still largely unknown to the average American, so it came as a surprise to learn my wife was stopping by the new Fitchi House to bring home a few Turkmeni delicacies, including the eponymous house specialty the Fitchi, which the website describes as ""a take on Turkmen traditional dish Ishlekli (Işlekli)"".
The Fitchi itself was delicious with a tasty meat filling (I suspect Vegans may be out of luck at the Fitchi House). The pastry was crispy and light. The filling also included quite a bit of broth that enhanced the taste but at the expense of serving as grab and go items - eat with a plate close at hand and a few napkins. We also had one Somsa, which we both found tasty; a distant cousin to the Samosas found on the other end of the Silk Road, I suspect. Perhaps it was this relationship that had me wishing for a little sauce to accompany it. The filling was similar to the Fitchi, however with a denser pastry shell, and it paired well. Still brothy and in need of that plate.
Fitchi House appears to be following the ""build the airplane as you fly it"" approach to their development process, so there were a few noticeable miscues: our 6 Fitchi/1 Somsa combo started out as a 3 and 3, and my wife left convinced she had agreed to a 4 and 2, but somehow we picked up a couple of Fitchis and lost a Somsa; a website that still pays a bit too much homage to Lorem ipso and needs some focused dev time; and potential brand confusion (the owner still manages the predecessor business, Milano Pizza, out of the location). I am also hopeful other fillings might be in the offing. As it is, there is a risk of the menu being a bit one note.
Nevertheless, it's hard to be too critical about a chance to eat this cuisine without the hassle of flying all the way to Ashgabat. Now all I need is a little kumis..."

We split some fried chicken (not my usual go-to, but it sounded right for the late-night mood) and a fitchi that came with a Yelp check-in, popped a squat and our food came out less than ten minutes later - chicken first, then the fitchi. And it. Was. Glorious. Definitely some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. We got their hot kind (I think the other option was barbeque) and the sauce was amazing and messy and tangy and perfect. And, we didn't walk away with that kinda nasty, greasy bloated feeling one can sometimes get from indulging in fried chicken - it was like something your mom would make from scratch. And the kitchi was great, too. Homey and hardy with a great blend of spices in the meat, plus a flakey crust and wonderfully soupy interior.
The inside is cute and small, perfect for a casual bite with a friend or two. The service is also very friendly and attentive. I think if we hadn't come so late at night, parking might have been difficult to find, but it's Wallingford so that's to be expected.

Their pizzas are insanely amazing. If you're looking for the perfect wood fired pizza with incredibly high quality ingredients, you're in luck.
The Margherita is a solid go-to - just an amazing cheesy and crispy experience. We always order our pizzas well done for that extra crispiness, so just a tip there if you like the same. The fun part of their pizzas is using the pizza scissors. I didn't realize those existed until visiting this place.
The toppings are super high quality, as I previously mentioned. For example, if you want mushrooms, you don't get plain white ones, you get chanterelle. My husband loves prosciutto and said there's is seriously awesome.
We've had a couple different salads and haven't quite found our fav yet. They had a Caesar, but we noticed the second time we went that it wasn't on the menu. It was just ok - it used a bitter lettuce that just didn't work. We next tried a salad that had rainbow radishes (looking online I don't see it so I don't know the exact name). It was great for what it was, but we would still try another one.
Service has always been awesome. Plus, we haven't ever had to wait (even on a Saturday at about noon) - but we've only gone in colder months, so not sure if it's more packed when the weather is nice.
Oh - and they have a nice wine menu, too (we've tried a few different reds and all have been nice - a stand out one to me is the Walla Walla Sangiovese).
All in all, it's worth the journey to give the pizza here a try!"

--and unfortunately, after a long time of patronage, favorable experiences, and reviews.
My partner and I took a Seattle friend to dinner, ordered a few rounds of wine, two different salads, and two pizzas. We ordered the second pizza (the Pera) about a half an hour after dinner, enjoying company. It was the only thing we shared. It unfortunately made the three of us all violently ill after 15 minutes of eating it. I was sick at the restaurant. Our friend wasn't well enough to travel home. My partner and I missed work.

We were seated right away. This is not a typical pizza place. You will not find a plain pepperoni pizza. You can't do half and half and they only have one size. I am ashamed to admit that I had to google some of the toppings. Then they bring out my pizza with scissors. Is this the new thing? What happened to slicing the pie for me? Not complaining, I just thought it was funny.
I shared the Margherita pizza with my friend. It was big enough to fill us up. The pizza had great flavor and the texture was on point. I will say the sauce was a little runny, but delicious.
I had a glass of wine and my friend got a cocktail.
My friend wanted a sweeter wine, but they didn't have one available. The staff was great. The waitress answered all of our questions and was always around when we needed her."

"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","McKensey A.","We popped in here at the recommendation of a local (and because it was right on main street) and it did not disappoint.
Wonderful artisan pizzas, big enough for 2 or 3 people depending on how hungry you are. All thin crust pizza served with scissors (!! how cool!) to cut however big or small of a slice you want. I loved this. Both pizzas (prosciutto & vegan) were wonderful - soft warm crust, fresh vegetables, light, but flavorful sauce. The dough is even vegan! Nothing was burnt and everything was cooked to perfection.
The appetizers were also wonderfully accompanied by a great drink menu. They had a great assortment of craft beers and cocktails. We ordered the meatballs to start and they were so flavorful, most, and delicious. Would recommend.
We came for lunch with friends and it was busy, but we were seated rather promptly. The staff was all super nice and prompt. The music was good, the bar was nice, and we really enjoyed our time here.

"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Nathan L.","Bruciato is an modernized pizza restaurant located right on the main street on Bainbridge island. We stopped by as we were getting off the ferry for lunch and everything was perfect! The pizza was top notch, the location was great, and the decor was super cool. It made the perfect addition to a Sunday outing with family!
We ordered two pizzas for our group of four and loved both of them. The pizza is thin with a crispy wood-fired crust baked in a oven at the back of the restaurant. Each pizza is covered with gourmet toppings - one of our pizzas was loaded with four different fancy cheeses and the other with prosciutto and arugula. The pizza comes out whole and they give you scissors to cut the pizzas into slices right at the table. It's a unique touch!
Besides the pizza, maybe my favorite part of Bruciato is the restaurant itself! The restaurant has a modern, industrial vibe that feels simple and upscale. Definitely more modern and fun than a run of the mill pizza joint. I loved all of the cool details throughout the restaurant like the high arched ceilings, metal light fixtures, and firewood stacked all around the oven. The front of the restaurant even has a giant articulated glass door that opens up on the street. When it's open on a nice day it feels like you're eating outside!
We came on a Sunday afternoon around 130 and had about a 20 minute wait for our group of four. We walked around the street and checked out the cool shops and they texted us when our table was ready.
If you're passing through Bainbridge or are looking for a cool spot on a day trip, Bruciato is the place for you!"

Bruciato is located along Winslow Way, which serves as the Island's quaint Main Street.
Wafts of the Wood-fired pizza greet you as you enter.
Our party of 6 was lucky enough to be sat immediately. As soon as we sat down, the line outside started to form.
The look:
Concrete floors, exposed wood beams, and open duct work. An open kitchen and bar let you watch the magic happen.
There is shelf that holds giant green jars that looked a little willy-nilly. It made me nervous.
As we scanned the menu, I ordered their take on an Old Fashioned. It was perfect!
We devoured the following:
Olive e focaccia: $6
Wood-fired flatbread. A nice starter while browsing the menu.
Insalata Verde: $12
Mixed green salad with pickled shallots, turmeric pickled cauliflower, and a red wine vinaigrette. This was a nice balance of ingredients perfectly dressed.
Funghi: $22
blue oyster and piopini mushrooms, house-made VEGAN mozzarella. OMG! I still dream about this pizza.
Side-note:
Pizza comes with scissors, cut- to-eat.
I washed it down with a lovely glass of Rosé.
Parking is on the street, and can be daunting at busier times.

The basil on the pizza was so yummy, that crispiness with the tangy margherita sauce was the perfect combo. But man, whoever decided to add peppadews to that salad def did not disappoint!
Staff here was super friendly! Luckily we came before the rush, so we didn't have to wait in line. We got seated near the window which had the perfect lighting and breeze. After lunch, you have plenty of boutiques, cafes, desserts to visit."
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Ron K.","This turned out to be a great find. I was trying to find a more upscale spot to check out with some veggie options and this place was recommended by some local friends. I'm not sure how long it has been at this location here but I know out all the times I've visited Bainbridge I've never been to this spot. Mind you the Island is not very veggie friendly like Seattle so when you do find something you jump on the chance.
Very cool open space that I would not call a storybook out of Italy, especially with the Miley Syrus and The Smiths playing in the background, but the working prechuto slicer at the bar and the stacked logs next to the Italian wood oven gets you pretty close to the real thing...
This place has a menu that could make any veg-head like me excited but when you are on islands sometimes the servers aren't like getting veg questions daily so it's a bit difficult to get the straight scoop on what's really in all of their dishes. For example I was inquiring on two dishes that are veg friendly but I got a hesitant response. I mean I read the full secription and it all seemed innocent of any animals but? For example they had a great looking dish of polenta with mushrooms Polenta al fungi that looked delicious or a veggie soup Zuppa de zucca but there seemed to be issues making vegan. All the salads were not vegan and they were like full sized entrees and no ability to get half sizes. Even the pizza menu is a bit confusing as I was trying to get a specialized vegan one but they didn't seem to have an easy way to do that except for adding things to a margarita pizza with their vegan house made cheese. But I didn't even want to ask the price of adding to an already $18 pizza so stuck to their single offering called Vegano. This had olives kale potato's roasted onions veg mozzarella and parm.
They have a pretty good wine and beer menu also. They had two Breakside ipas on tap one was a winter IPA that was pretty tasty and went for that!
One fun little fact about this place is they bring scissors with your pizza to do your own cutting. They will do the cutting it up if you want but I kind of got into it because you can make your exact size slices which for me are tiny 2 inch wide slices:). And now to the pizza taste it was 5 stars for sure. The crust was ultra thin but the crust was chewy and full of flavor. The red sauce was super tasty and all the toppings were very good. If I could customize which I'll try next time to do would be to sub out the potato for some mushrooms. I've never quite got why people like potatoes on a dough crust pizza. I guess it's filling when you are in the Northwest. My friend is a totally meat eater and she gave me no leftovers to eat so there you go on an endorsement!
Service is very friendly and efficient. Sometimes I thought it was a bit too quick to either take orders or close out bill but the place was not that crowded so it's understandable.
To sum up great place that could be improved if they allow more modifications without charging you a fortune. Also maybe mark up the menu to what you can veganify would be helpful. Overall if you are on this Island I would run not walk here as it's one of the few veggie friendly spots on the island. Definitely close to 5 star material at least the time I checked this place out."

"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Sarah C.","I'm a lucky lady as I've had a lot of great pizza... I'm in between 3 and 4 for this area! It's a 4.5 for the area but a 2.5 for competitors.
Pros?
Thin crust
Good beer menu
Tasty toppings
Large even though they're all one size
Reasonable pricing
Cons?
Crust that's thin shouldn't be soggy... but it was
Tips?
Cut the pizza... it's cool you provide scissors to do it yourself... but... just cut the pizza..."
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Mary T.","WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW. I lalalalalaLOVE this place. Bruciato really knows how to nail a flavorful pizza. I had the meatballs and pizza with the prosciutto and dates (I forgot the name of it).
The meatballs were definitely big, juicy, and flavorful (get your head out of the gutter). I can really taste a variety of italian herbs and the marinara? sauce is the perfect balance between garlicy, sweet, and salty.
The pizza with dates was also just as perfect, the crust was light, the dates added a great sweetness to accompany the saltiness of the prosciutto.
A true gem on Bainbridge Island!"
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Daniel F.","On an impromptu trip for lunch to Bainbridge, my colleague from the island suggested we try pizza here, and I was blown away by the options here. Everything was freshly made and extremely appetizing. Given that this was more of a business lunch, I did not pay very close attention to the drink list, but the wine selection seemed very good from my vantage point. They have some amazing flavors and ingredients that you won't find many other places. Flowers and mushrooms on pizza?! It was amazing. My only disappointment is I didn't take a picture of it when it was fresh because it was a beautiful pie. Would definitely go back.
This establishment is right in the heart of downtown and gives you amazing seating options by their front window on a beautiful day. You couldn't ask for a better place for a relaxing lunch or dinner with good friends and neighbors. The service was great as well, and they managed the lunch rush well, especially for a day when everyone was out trying to enjoy the weather. The idea here is sharing a pie or admitting you're going take the rest with you and probably destroy it on the ferry back to the mainland. It would definitely be a great place to take a larger group so you can cut it up (yes I said cut) and share with more. Speaking of cutting it up, they give you pizza shears instead of a pizza slicer, and it works out amazing. At first I was confused but once I used it, I loved it. Need to plan more trips to Bainbridge so I can enjoy places like this!"
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Monica C.","Great atmosphere! Very minimalistic italian restaurant and authentic pizza, tastes just like the pizza i have eaten in Italy! We got the potato and pancetta pizza and it was a good sharing size for two. $~20 after tax and tip for the pizza. 3/5 Service, 5/5 food!"
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Robert B.","This might be an unfair review. I reserve the right to revise up.
THE ROSES: Truly excellent pizza. Pizzas are made in a wood fired (apple wood) oven in the back on the dining area, and they're done in the Neapolitan style. Large selection of pizzas featuring what appear to be only the finest in toppings. Classic Italian and artisan styles; don't even THINK of asking for Canadian Bacon and pineapple here. Good selection of top-quality and rather creative appetizers and salads. Remarkably pleasant and professional staff, especially when you consider that they'd been slammed on a Friday night for probably at least five hours! Remarkably decent prices, when you consider the neighborhood and the quality.
THE THORNS: Dining room is a bit loud, and I wasn't crazy about the hip-hop heavy playlist. The big deal is that they really need to work on the estimates for wait times that they give. Our one-hour wait was more like two hours. Good thing it was Art Walk night, so we had something to do!
WHY TWO STARS? I really think they could've done a better job with estimating the wait times, or at least acknowledged that they kind of sold us a bill of goods. I realize that this is more art than science, but I think they could've done better.
TOP TIP: Look into trying Yelp's 'Waitlist' feature. Give people an opportunity to hang out on their boat for cocktails while they wait for their table!
THE VERDICT: Superb pizza that is worth the wait, but only just so. Tread carefully, my friends: you're the only game in town right now for top-tier pizza, but if you continue to leave patrons waiting for hours, someone could come and eat your lunch. Just sayin'..."
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Andrew M.","This place is legit. It's a 10 minute walk from the ferry stop and you're going to get fast service and fresh artisan pizza.
From a design standpoint, the restaurant is beautiful and elegant. Colored vases line the walls toward the pizza oven with an intricate white tile exterior. The food was amazing. The margherita pizza was good and checked all the boxes, but nothing exciting about it. The funghi was delicious. The generous amount of mushrooms added a crunch in addition to it's earthy flavorful profile. And the cipolla was something I've never had before, and I'm so glad I tried it because now I will be looking out for it at other pizza places. Honey and sheep cheese, straight up magical...
Margherita - 8/10
Funghi - 9/10
Cipolla - 10/10"
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Kamrie S.","This place has good pizza but definitely more authentic/gourmet style. No bbq chicken or anything like that. I'm not very educated in Italian cooking so even reading the menu for me was a struggle! Had to google some words oops.
I ordered a prosciutto pizza. It comes with a salad of arugula on it. A little more then my liking, it made the cut your own slices process difficult but it was still good.
Although the food wasn't my favorite I give them 5 stars for the great service. There was a problem with my moms salad, but our server Sarah was so nice! She said she would let the cooks know of the issue, then gave us her email so we could contact her if any further problems arrived. She gave us tiramisu on the house (which by the way was excellent), then to our surprise took the salad and one of our pizza off the bill!
A fine establishment with good food and great service."
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Shaylor S.","The pizza is still killer and the warm water they give you still tastes like plastic. I wish they'd give you water with ice and do something about the taste. Also you feel really stupid trying to order because I don't speak Italian haha! The names are hard to pronounce. Love the atmosphere here and it's pretty packed on a Saturday night. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. Not bad. Definitely one of the best places you can go on the island though!"
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christy N.","Like OMG I've discovered a cool, tasty fun lil hidden gem.
Like the pizzas are is so good. Kinda cramp/crowded as you get into the door. But like it's a separate seating section which has a good space.
The ladies are super super friendly. You know the type that should be working in customer service because they have the personality and attitude for it. Oh back to the food, well the pizza pies can generally feed 2 or if your super hungry you can if you want to admit it chow down the whole thing. I like that the menu isn't super complicated or over whelming with options.
The only negative is that it is in some what awkward spot and it is tough to find in the evening. Wish there was a big lighted sign. The neighborhood lacks good lighting and gets really dark like darker then usually at night for an area with restaurants."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kelsey B.","Y'all. I LOVE PIZZA..... unfortunately, I didn't love Delancey
Two of us quickly grabbed a table on Saturday night around 6PM hungry and ready to feast. Let me start by saying the service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and quick. We grabbed a nice bottle of red to enjoy with the pies (reasonably priced ~$50). My husband got a Margherita and I went for the Romana. Again, service was super quick and our pies came out quickly.
Unfortunately they just didn't taste great. The Margherita was burnttt (see pic). These wood fire pies usually take under 5 minutes to cook and I feel like for this kind of place they should have just made another pie real quick rather than serving us up something this burnt. And the Romana was so salty it was not even edible.
We are been looking forward to coming to Delancey for awhile now. I've heard such great things about this spot and it looks like a lot of fellow yelpers also agree that this place is good, we must have had an off night. There are a lot of great pies in town and Delancey just isn't something I would trek over to check out again."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lee G.","It would certainly help Delancey if the first person you meet, the hostess, was even slightly polite. But as can be referenced by several Yelp reviews - the hostess puts herself above the establishment and the patrons by treating interested customers with nothing but attitude and a power trip.
Our waitress was not much better, and instead of fire we got ice. She didn't smile once during any interaction and seemed humorless and unhappy to be at Delancey in general. At the end of our meal when my friend mentioned that the pizza should be labeled as spicy, she gave no apology and instead listed the ingredients.
To top it off, the pizza wasn't very good. Not that Delancey should be given a pass for rude behavior by making up for it with delicious pizza, but their pizza isn't even worth dealing with the unfriendly vibe."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Klarke C.","Delaney is a lovely neighborhood delight tucked in Ballard with some of the best pizza in Seattle (if not the best).
We were promptly seated without a reservation so if you're not able to make one online don't let that sway you from coming! I ordered the half Brooklyn, half bacon and onion with added mushrooms! It was cheesy crispy deliciousness"
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tabatha J.","Not sure why so many people rave about this place.
We arrived and put our name on the list. Went next door to grab an app and drink while we waited 30-40 min which was very convenient.
We got notified via text out table was ready and we're seated. It's a bit crazy at the door trying to get past people waiting and people trying to get in the list.
Our table was great and we ordered our pizza 1/2 bacon onion 1/2 sausage.
We'd thought about ordering 2 and I'm happy we didn't. The edges of the pizza were not lightly charred and beautiful from coming from the oven, all the edges were charred black. When I went to slide a piece off the pan lol the toppings slid off and went on the table. The center didn't seem quite cooked- more soppy. Also I've heard great things about the flavor of the dough. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't have a crust to taste but it lacked in flavor.
I didn't leave satisfied and was still hungry but decided id rather go to Cornuto or another nearby oven fired thin crust pizza place.
Customer service was good
Was pricey for what you get."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Emily I.","I am really disappointed to have to write this review, as one of my good friends has been RAVING about the food Delancey's and I was really looking forward to trying it.
My party showed up on a Saturday evening and of course Delancey's was busy. There was a table available outside so we sat down and waited to be served. Within a few minutes we were told (rather rudely) that they were not serving outside that night because it was about to rain.
No big deal, we decided we either wanted to put our name on the list or order a few pizzas to go and take our chances with the weather (chairs were still out and there was no sign saying they weren't serving outside). We decided to split up our party and while some went in to order the pizzas, some went to order drinks from next door to enjoy while we were waiting.
We were refused the ability to order drinks, order pizzas, or put our name on the list. Not only were we completely off put by that, the hostess told us to ""go across the street if we wanted a drink"" and basically kicked us out. Another hostess attempted to apologize for her colleague's behavior, and allow us to order pizzas to go, but it was far too late for that.
I certainly hope the TERRIBLE customer service isn't a regular occurrence at Delancey's, but I probably won't be back to find out."

Come early and put your name in so you can enjoy a drink at the conjoined bar called Essex. We are pretty easy to please when it comes to pizza, we argue about toppings so we often get two pies and leave FULLER THAN FULL. My wife and I have been here countless times and enjoy it very much, if you don't want to wait then check it out on a weekday. Don't be dismayed by any bad reviews due to the poor planning of some other yelpers before trying a restaurant, the staff has always been kind and friendly."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sheryl K.","The boyfriend and I were craving pizza for dinner. He wanted to try this place out so we decided to head over.
Street parking was a little challenging to find in that area, but we managed to find a spot fairly close by.
It's a pretty nice spot--not too big or small. They have a bar, a bunch of tables, and two restrooms. It was dimly lit but bright enough to comfortably eat and have nice conversation.
We each ordered a glass of wine and shared their mushroom pizza.
The two main reasons why I decided to give this place 3 stars is because the pizza was just alright. Our crust was a little burnt, but it wasn't a deal breaker. But I was hoping that the flavor would compensate for the semi-burnt crust. Unfortunately it didn't and it kind of bummed us out.
Second, the server, although pretty friendly when she first took our order, seemed either too busy with other tables, or maybe was preoccupied? But my boyfriend had noticed that when she came to our table to check on us, she walked up to our table to ask how we were doing, but was looking elsewhere and didn't give us any eye contact. It was weird enough that my boyfriend noticed. I guess for me, if the server doesn't really want to check up on our table, I'd rather they just drop the check off than half ass the acknowledgement.
After leaving the restaurant I was still craving something--anything to fulfill my flavor craving. I wasn't all that hungry but still felt like I needed something. So we ended up going to Jack N the Box to top the night off.
Can't say it was the best meal, but it wasn't horrible. But I can say that I'm happy that we at least tried it. Maybe it was the type of pizza that we ordered, who knows? Unfortunately, I can't say that we'll be returning anytime soon."

My girlfriend suggested pizza, which led me to discover Delancey, just a few blocks from our Airbnb. It couldn't have been a better situation.
Great lighting, stylish decor, chill wait staff with super speedy service. We had some great wine and local beers and enjoyed the classic Margherita pizza. The real highlight of the experience was a delicious homemade chocolate chip cookie á la mode.
If you're wanting to continue the night check out the bar at Essex right next door for chill cocktails."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Andrew E.","Pizza is fire. Best pizza in Seattle along with bar del corso. Less is more when it comes to the amount of toppings on pizza and Delancey gets that."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Eva C.","We have been meaning to try out Delancey for a while 1. because we live really close and 2. we've heard the raves. Tonight was finally the night! We decided to order take out so we could enjoy our meal at home with our dog. We called in to make a to go order and the woman over the phone had a very rude tone and told us we cannot order over the phone we must come in person. This is pretty odd to me because the point of ordering to go is so you don't have to wait at the restaurant. We luckily live about 3 blocks away so we shrugged it off and went in to order. Once arriving there it was just a series of issues and utter rudeness from the hostess.
1 - messes up order; we ordered the sausage and the bacon and onion pizzas (2 separate pizzas on the menu), she charged us for a sausage pizza with bacon and onion.
2 - miss charges me; first charged us for 1 pizza with add-ons then charges us for 3 pizzas.
3 - messes up the void; doesn't void the original incorrect order; total jumped from $25 to $66
4 - fixes the void but doesn't provide receipt for proof
5 - doesn't acknowledge me when I ask for proof, just grabs the receipt and hands it to me; very cold, unfriendly, terrible customer experience.
The pizza itself was good. Nothing mind blowing or particularly unique. Perhaps it was over hyped to me, perhaps this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm giving this place a two stars because I was satisfied with my pizzas.
I've gone on this long without having Delancey and I'm fine continuing on the rest of my life not eating it again. I expected a much better customer experience and I'm highly disappointed."

Made reservations for our anniversary here after seeing a favorite chef post a photo from Essex (cocktail bar next door) and I'm so glad I found this place. The jersey salad and pizza may seem simple enough but truly, I would book a trip back across the country just to eat here again.
We tried Essex on two other occasions of this trip and not only were the cocktails incredible, the small(er) menu delicious, but the service was friendly and inviting. Our waitress the first night gave us a handwritten list of her must-see Seattle recommendations which we loved.
After visiting, I read the Delancey book, which I also recommend and loved being able to read the behind the scenes of how the restaurant was born and 5/5 would recommend the restaurant, the bar, and the book."

I've been a fan of Orangette since college, and I remember reading about this place when they opened and wanting to check it out. We took an Uber here, and it was a cozy and intimate spot, which I didn't mind because I was there with one of my good friends. So maybe my review is a rad biased because I already liked the food that Molly made on her blog.
I ended up ordering the Hot Salami pizza, which was soooo good. Beautifully presented, with slightly charred and bubbled topping. The freshness from the pizza seriously complemented the slightly sweet burnt edges, which was surprising to me. It was definitely large enough to split between two people or to just split up for a few meals as I did. :)
All in all, it was a very solid pizza, cooked with a deliciously chewy crust and stacked with tons of meat. I would love to go back again the next time I'm in the area."

"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Megha T.","Came here after an entire day of gorging myself, and man do I regret that because I wish I could have eaten three of these pizzas by myself!
My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night after he read Molly Wizenberg's book and recommended we do dinner here. Despite its apparent fame, the restaurant was pretty empty for Saturday night at 8:30 pm but I'm not complaining since we were expecting a moderate wait!
We were immediately seated and our server was attentive and helpful. We ordered their hot salami pizza ($17) and the chocolate chip cookie ($3.50), as well as a pint of beer each. I can't remember which kinds we got but they were perfectly cold, contrasting with the oven-hot pizza.
Also yes - the pizza, oh baby. Dough was perfectly cooked, a bit tangy from the sourdough, and the sauce and cheese are divine. I wouldn't consider myself someone who loves pizza (more of a tacos gal) but this pizza made me consider it. The hot salami was fantastic, as well. If you're hungry, definitely get your own pizza! Even if you don't finish, the leftovers will be good.
As for the chocolate chip cookie, either get it in cookie dough or skip it and choose something else. After the amazing pizza, I had high expectations for it but it was a bit of a letdown because it was brittle and bitter."

Now the crust is still as good as ever, but they burnt it quite a bit on our last visit. They replaced the interesting toppings (remember the kimchi) with generic ingredients. They also made a common mistake of overloading their pizza with cheese and sauces. It turned a once-beautiful crust very soggy.
Maybe I judged them too harshly, because they're held to a much higher standard in my mind. What changed for them? New management? Complacency? It could just be a really bad day, too."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Camille J.","As someone who grew up on New York thin crust pizza, I'd say this is definitely some of the best I've been able to find in Seattle. My friend and I tried the bacon and onion pizza and the crimini mushroom pizza, and we both enjoyed the crimini pizza a lot more. The red sauce wasn't out of this world, so the simplicity of the crimini pizza was just right. Plenty of mushrooms for a nice umami flavor. Unfortunately, the middle of the crimini pizza was soggy. Still have a little more thin crust perfection to strive for.
This is certainly a popular restaurant. It was pretty bumpin even when we arrived at 9pm on a weeknight, and people were still coming in after us. Regardless, the service was excellent. Our water glasses were constantly being filled up (we arrived at the restaurant thirsty and were constantly guzzling down the water), and our waitress was prompt and friendly. Would recommend!"

Ordered the mushroom pie with pepperoni but when it
Came only had mushrooms, no pepperoni :( - waitress came around after 6-7 mins to check in on us, but honestly we were starving and waiting for our order to be corrected/remade was not worth the time.
Mushrooms were almost dry, like the way you eat them dry in a salad bar. They're kind of lightly cooked in olive oil, but almost just for a second. The pie was white with no red sauce, cheese and mushroom. Crust was white and kind of bland. Service from front hostess and our hostess was great, but can't make up for a boring pizza.
The addition of any kind of meat could have saved it, but alas white pie with semi dry mushrooms it was."

The birthday boy even ended up receiving a free dessert which was an unexpected but welcome surprise.
The reason why I gave this place only 4 stars was because of my food. My friend got the fettuccine with clams and thoroughly enjoyed his food because it was piping hot. Me on the other hand, ordered the Campanelle and my pasta wasn't warm to the slightest bit. I know my pasta was probably done before my friend's but I wish there was someway to keep dishes warm so we both could have enjoyed our food.

If you're looking at the menu and don't know what to order, get the Campanelle dish with chicken, and unless you love goat cheese, swap it for Parmesan.

Also, these are the most unique pasta noodles you will ever eat.
I've never had a bad experience here. And they've been nothing but accommodating when I've brought my 1 year old. Very happy staff, delicious food worth every $, and out of all the restaurants in the Village, this one is my #1 if I want to sit down with my family."

Things to Order: Small plate of House Made Pappardelle, Penne, Fries"
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Libby C.","Oh man, how did I JUST discover the fact that Piatti has a great happy hour menu? Mondays and Tuesdays are up to $25 off a bottle of wine, making most bottles half off! My friend and I shared a $40 bottle of Pinot Grigio making it only $20 due to happy hour. We each had the margarita pizza, our fabulous server Nikki brought over fresh shaved Parmesan and omg it was delicious. The pizza was simple yet perfect. She told us the menu rotated and recommended the rosemary olives, I will certainly try that next time. We will be back for sure."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Allison C.","Overpriced, mediocre pasta.
One of my boyfriend's favorite foods of all time is squid ink pasta. So, when we heard this place served it, we decided that we had to come try it for ourselves.
Atmosphere: Probably the best part of our experience. We came in on a Wednesday night. Our area by the windows was peaceful and sparsely populated, making it the perfect location for a nice, pleasant dinner.
Food: I ordered the gnocchi while my boyfriend ordered (you guessed it) the squid ink fettuccine. I was so incredibly let down by the gnocchi. It had no flavor whatsoever; it was like I was eating tasteless carbs. It was my boyfriend's first time ever trying gnocchi, and he was let down by the experience as well.
The squid ink fettuccine, on the other hand, was delicious. However, the quantity was minimal. Despite also ordering a basketful of bread to share between the two of us, my boyfriend was still hungry after eating half of the bread basket plus the fettuccine. At the price point of the meal (discussed shortly), I don't think that should be happening.
Price: It was $16 for each plate of pasta, plus around $3.50 for bread. Combined with tax and tip, we were looking at over $45 for a meal that didn't even make the two of us full. Yikes.
Service: We received our food pretty quickly after ordering, which I appreciated. Our waiter was pleasant, but didn't go out of his way to be extra personable.
Overall: Try another pasta joint for better taste and more bang for your buck. I will likely not be back."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","A L.","Pretty good food, but maybe not award winning. Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice atmosphere. The prices reflect the location, so keep that in mind."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Valerie W.","I wanted to like this place, but it's overpriced and the food is mediocre at best.
Happy Hour is only $1 off certain items...like really...that is not a very happy hour.
I came in seeking HH while out shopping and mostly just wanted some good wine. The rose I had was indeed delicious even if it was over $12.
Staff was good - attentive.
$3 bread...eh. It was fine. More than enough for people to share.
$10 grilled octopus...I wouldn't recommend. First off, I got severe food poisoning. Second, it was overcooked and super charred making it chewy. The whole plate aside from the little salad was not the most appetizing and super salty. Just not a good overall experience.
I can see this place is trying to be a bit more upscale, and the interior is nice...but I don't think I'd be coming back any time soon."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Erin J.","Living in West Seattle, I rarely make it to University Village. I decided to make the trek to the Village over the three day weekend, and had my eye on Piatti for happy hour and to grab dinner to go. Boy, it did NOT disappoint.
I am a sucker for good octopus, which isn't an item you see on a ton of menus around the Pacific Northwest. I was thrilled to see it on their happy hour menu, which is what initially drew me here. It seems they have a rotating preparation of the octopus. When I stopped in, it was wood-fired octopus with chorizo braised white beans, tomato confit, and arugula. At $10 on happy hour, it's a steal. This dish was simply to die for. The octopus was unbelievably tender and paired so well with the smokey chorizo and creamy white beans. It was a struggle to finish it all and could truly serve as a meal in and of itself. However, we did also order one order of their ciabatta bread. The bread was excellent as well: so soft and fluffy seasoned perfectly with salt, garlic, and some other herbs. It was served with olive oil and a nice herbed balsamic vinegar. I'd definitely recommend it to accompany your meal, especially at a mere $3 on happy hour.
To go, I ordered their house made pappardelle and duck bolognese. This, too, was heavenly. I've had other house made pasta that was too thin and mushy. I appreciated this fresh pasta really maintained its integrity. It was still nice and elastic even after reheating at home. And the bolognese itself was perfection. Though prepared classically with carrot, celery, and Italian spices, it was really a memorable dish. The duck was a refreshing change from the typically heavy and often flavorless beef you get in so many bolognese dishes.
The restaurant itself is massive. We were promptly seated and the service was friendly. The drinks are a bit on the high side, even on happy hour, but the phenomenal happy hour and killer dinners more than made up for it.
Overall, I think Piatti is a must-stop when you're in the U-Village area."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy N.","Very cute place. Extremely clean and aesthetically pleasing. Their kitchen puts mine to shame.
Randall was our server, he was super attentive, super nice and did a very good job at explaining the menu to us.
Food overall was pretty tasty. I got a taste of everyone's dish at the table and wasn't disappointed by any. I ordered the duck fettuccine, my sister ordered the gnocchi (flippin' amazing), and my cousin ordered the puttanesca.
The only negative I would have to say is that prices are a little north of what we're used to paying. Ex: lunch was a little more than I'd normally pay at another restaurant. The lunch portions were also on the smaller side. But, keep in mind you are in U-Village at a fairly nice restaurant."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sheri C.","Great food, lovely atmosphere and sweet waiters and staff for the full service of our company event today.
Came here for lunch and a champagne toast (I had water) after volunteering with colleagues today. Had a lovely buffet set up for us with a bartender for those who wanted an adult beverage.
The presentation was nice. I sat outdoors on the patio. It was 86 F today so the sun umbrellas were welcomed. They had a blanket at each table for folks just in case.
For the food, I had the following:
Pita bread, hummus & tomato - everything was super fresh and the bread was great
Cheese board
Prosciutto wrapped cantaloupe - melon was a tad under ripe
Arancini - perfection
Meatball slider - tangy sauce, just right bread and perfect portion of meatball
Chicken satay - didn't get any sauce; chicken was tender
Will come back and try something on their regular menu soon."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Branden B.","My wife and I ordered 2 things. Margharita pizza and the meat and cheese plate. The pizza was the winner by a mile.
The meat and cheese plate? Needs help. It wasn't even about the meat and cheese that comes with the plate, those were great! The brie and fig jam along with grilled bread was fantastic too.
But the sides they added with it was just odd to me. It really brought the experience down. Instead of some nuts, or pickles or crackers... they give you beets??
Beets!?
No. I do not like knowing what the earth tastes like. Thank you.
Also, the pickled veggies I was excited about was actually carrots (only one slice) celery (fine I'll eat it) but then get this... onions. Pickled onions. Not even the purple kind you may find on a fancy taco somewhere. Why would anyone want to eat pickled onions like that?
I may be in the minority here with that one. But I haven't seen it before so it threw me off.
The place itself was awesome. Staff professional and classy. Place was empty when we got there but jam packed by the time we were done. There is definitely a lunch rush here.
One last thing. Lift weights before you come to eat here. You're going to need extra muscles to open that heavy ass door."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Solaia F.","My date tonight never showed but I had already taken the time to get ready and drive 30 minutes here so I decided to stay and treat myself instead. I'm so happy I did! Michael H. was my server tonight and he made my evening and my dinner at Piatti an enjoyable and memorable experience! I've worked in the service industry for years and I acknowledge superior customer service and if I could give him 6 stars, I would. Aside from being attentive, accommodating and professional, he recommended the best Piatti has to offer! I'll definitely be recommending this restaurant to all of my clients for their date-nights and special occasions"
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nanci D.","My food was incorrect and my friend was finished by the time mine arrived. Subpar Italian food. Won't be back"
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tammy Y.","I hadn't been back to Piatti since the remodel but decided to go there for happy hour last week with a friend. I arrived at 5:30 and sat at one of the high tops in the bar/lounge area, where happy hour is served. The female server came by to ask if I was waiting for anyone and I let her know I was. She wasn't what I would deem friendly in any sense of the word, but took my drink order and came back with in shortly.
My friend arrived about 15 minutes later and we placed our dinner order. Again, the server was less than warm and friendly. We ordered the margherita pizza, arancini, and salad with prawns. The food was very good. Unfortunately the service being less than welcoming, and the prices being so high (happy hour isn't so much a deal as much as regular dinner prices) will deter me from returning in the future."
"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dee G.","Very average restaurant. Came here to have a quick drink after spending hours shopping. It took the waitress 20 mins to even acknowledge my presence. Thats when I finally got some water. Ordered a glass of wine and focaccia bread with oil. The bread was very average. I might have stayed for dinner but nothing from the menu seemed appealing. Tried looking on yelp to see if people were raving about anything but most people thought of piatti as a average restaurant. This restaurant is at such a prime location. I wish they up their game before its too late."
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Linda L.","Honestly, I've lived walking distance to this place for over a year now and I never thought of stepping in because of my Starbucks bias... Why go to a large chain when there are all these small coffee shops around town?
Well, I walked in one day and had a foccaccia pizza and a pastry, and lemme tell you, I was back the next day for more. The pizza especially is divine, and I really recommend it.
Now I'm a huge fan of this place!"
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Patrick V.","ATMOSPHERE: Clean, feng-shui, elegant but warm and inviting. Not crazy loud even when busy. Large high-top community table, a few solo window benches and then a bar side, cafe-style dining room. There is food in a hot case on display, then a coffee bar, then an alcoholic bar.
FOOD: The pizza is insane good, unique and a once in a while treat, as it is quite oily and buttery. Non-traditional style as they are square and without tomatoe sauce. One large slice they cut into 8th costs $8. Well worth it in my opinion. The pastries look lovely as do the bread loaves however I cannot vouch for them.
Espresso is nice as it is an offshoot chain of Starbucks Reserve. No order too strange or difficult for them and the taste is smooth, rich and well crafted.
SERVICE: They are usually pretty slammed as it is right in the Amazon torn butthole of Seattle but the cafeteria-style line is efficient.
PRICE: Average for the area."
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Brandy M.","Princi is owned by Starbucks and is one of their ""Reserve"" locations. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the coffee and food were great. My only complaint would be the price, which seemed higher than normal.
The avocado toast was one of the best I've ever had (not as salty as some!), and was made fairly plain - on a ""normal"" slice of sourdough bread (vs. a thick cut), a nice but thin layer of avocado, and a small but perfect amount of baby arugula on top.
(I also ordered a ""raisin stick,"" for later... it's like a sourdough breadstick with raisins cooked into it - DELISH!!!!! It's literally my favorite item at the Starbucks Reserve locations!)"
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Chaeji K.","Came here for coffee with work friends! Great place to meet up and they're dog friendly. But definitely more over priced than your traditional starbucks (got a single shot 12 oz americano for $4.25!)"

"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Theresa B.","Came here before an event to kill some time. This place has a great overall social space. There's long tables, a bar seating area, some booths, and outdoor seating around a fire pit. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the pastries but I can see why Starbucks has an exclusive deal with them. So good. Not too sweet, heavy or oily. They have the perfect pastry texture that is signature to European desserts.
The most memorable part of the experience was the staff. We had Noah help us out. Oh my gosh. The two times he helped us out, I felt like we were BFFs. Friendly conversation, patient when we were deciding, made awesome recommendations, just an overall welcoming vibe. Will definitely come back to this location."
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Madison S.","I am absolutely in love with a Princi. I've stopped by here for lunch or a coffee with coworkers a few times.
Atmosphere: there is a really cool visual setup of all the food. Bread wall, pizzas, salads and pastries are all laid out on a counter in a beautiful way to view while in line. There's limited seating - though I typically have only 2 or 3 people in my party so we always find a seat.
Food: I've only had the flatbread but they've both been amazing. Crust and toppings are great. The seasonal squash one was delightful and the service lady recommended it to me! I typically get a flatbread and a large cold brew. The coffee has been amazing both times. I love the style of their cups.
Keep up the good work Princi !"

I had the focaccia caprese sandwich which was good. One of my coworkers got the salami mozzarella sandwich which he thought was decent at best. The coffee was really good as expected but I don't think it's that great of a lunch place considering all the options in the area.

I would recommend the Avocado Toast with Salmon if you are going for something quick and simple, but the Cornetto alle Fragole is delicious too!
Great spot for work or play!"
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Katie C.","Perfect place for a nicer lunch in South Lake Union. After visiting Italy, Princi is spot on similar to the cafes I visited there.
The line winds in front of a case which has sandwiches and pizza in it. I ordered a small sandwich to split and a piece of the Funghi Pizza. After sitting down (Beautiful wooden seats), I noted there was also salads and pastas further down. Maybe they should put those more visible (I though sandwich and pizza were my only options). Will have to try those next time.
I didn't get any of the reserve drinks but plan to next time with one of the delicious looking pastries or croissants."

"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Shandelle B.","This is a great edition to the Starbucks line of stores right in the heart of the South Lake Union neighborhood.
They are open early for your daily caffeine fix or late with a full bar specializing in classic Italian wines and cocktails. The indoor and outdoor seating make this a great respite from the rain or a nice place to lounge in the sun.
The staff is almost too friendly here. Since most of the menu is full or Italian words, they are quick and happy to offer suggestions or explanations.
I only wish we would have had time to stay longer and sample some of the food or libations since they all looked so delicious. However, the nitro cold brew I got was pretty great and really provided that afternoon pick-me-up I was looking for.
I only wish they offered some gluten free pastries along with all of the other delectable-looking items."
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","David H.","Let me preface this review by saying I hate pizza! The only time id eat a pizza (or anything similar) is if I'm absolutely starving, but when i stepped inside Princi, that mindset flew out the window! The pizza, along with everything else they offered, looked and tasted delicious!
We ordered the stagioni pizza, beef lasagna, and a cinnamon roll. Everything here looks appealing which made it a hard pick. There were only 2 options for pasta but many pizza choices and a few soups. The stagioni pizza was nice and light - I'd recommend this. The pasta had a good sauce that wasn't overpowering, although the olives were super salty? Cinnamon roll was decent but I'd recommend getting something more unique. Portion sizing was a good amount for a light lunch but dinner is questionable. Prices aren't too expensive with most items at or below $10.
The service here is great! Employees were really friendly in answering questions about each dish as well as how to pronounce them... haha. I'd say this is a nice spot for lunch or dessert. If you're into pastries, pizza, and coffee, go try Princi!"

Princi serves incredible baked goods. We ordered several items and shared them among the three of us. I always enjoy chocolate brioches. I tried a raspberry cornetti. I didn't think that I would like the raspberry filling, but it was surprisingly delicious. The filling definitely added to the flavor. The almond croissant was also tasty. What was surprising was that although the cornetti and the croissant are made with the same ingredients (excluding the filling) and look similar, the croissant was very light and airy while the cornetti was denser.
I thought that the baked goods at Princi were some of the best I've ever had. I'll definitely have to come back on future business trips."

Buffalo pizza, calzone and clam pizza were all incredibly delicious
Service good
Cons:
Too dark of an ambiance for me.
Food is not only about satisfying the hunger but also pleasing the senses, which is extremely important for overall satisfaction.
Beautiful colors of freshly and masterfully cooked ingredients pleasing to the eyes are just as important as smell, texture and taste. It was too dark to see my food.
My recommendation would be to increase lighting a bit where it's still a pleasant atmosphere and customers can take advantage of good lighting to actually see the beautiful creations of the chef. After all it's not a bedroom, it's a dining room."
"Via Tribunali","https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-tribunali-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Jason C.","Been to Capitol Hill many times but first Time at this location and it night and day. So many things wrong with the food.
Burrata was brought out with a few cherry tomatoes. The waiter asked us if we wanted anything to go with it. We ask for bread because in my experience it comes with bread. Told us she'll put in a order of focaccia but need to warm it in the oven. A) we got our focaccia after or main came out b) it was just pizza flat bread without toppings not focassia c) why didn't you suggest this when we place our order instead of after bring it out
Then the pasta was pretty much boiled spaghetti in a soup. I've never seen bolognese sauce so pink and watery you can spoon and slurp it like tomatoe soup. The spaghetti all's vongole was under season and just tasted like water. It was hard to get someone to bring some salt."

The burrata, which at $16 for about 3-4oz doesn't come with anything to eat it with so the service offered focaccia, but it was $5 more. $21 for burrata. Then we order a pizza a salad. The pizza was supposed to have mozzarella on it, but instead came cheeseless with arugula instead. Rather than offering to comp the piZza or make a new one, they have us 25% off, which felt paltry. Our server was very helpful and prompt and gracious, but it felt like he was trying to swim upstream with a poorly run kitchen and grouchy management. Even if there had beee cheese on the pizza, it was still pretty bland. Over priced and not worth it. I have a bad taste in my mouth now."

We've been served with a plate 80% full of water, and shells, pasta was very little and all broken in pieces.
I politely made my note to the waitress, and she literally ignored what I was telling her.
I understand that pasta dish may not be the most frequent order, but then I would suggest to just remove it from the menu, and focus on what you can cook consistently well.

Holy CRAP Burien! Don't tell the others....don't spread the word that this place exists.
I can't believe I have finally found a place that actually gets pasta. Like, truly gets it. This place is pretty much the pasta whisperer. I had the Gorgonzola thingy, Mozzarella rapini, and some glorious pizza that had arugula in it. I'm still salivating and its been almost 24 hours.
This place is not only a gem, but should easily be in some sort of America's best pasta places top ten list. For real."

I work next to this restaurant and frequent it several times a year with my co-workers. The service is always great, the food is always tasty, and the ambiance is cozy with it's white tablecloths, comfortable chairs, and dim lighting (my favorite).
I've had several pasta dishes here from the Gnocchi al Forno to the Penne Estive and all have been good. The Insalata Primo is a great salad to start with too. The wines are always good. On a recent visit I had the Limoncello cake and that was divine. I'm not a big fan of cake but had no problem polishing this one off. A good solid Italian restaurant in the heart of Olde Burien."

This sounded simple... sounded easy.... you know.... ""Anyone could do this"". But what was delivered was simply one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.
Our Sister Mel lives close to here and knows the owners and chef well.... so of course we were greeted very warmly.... and I observed repeatedly every guest that came in behind us ... even if a stranger.... got the same warm Italian gracious embrace of hospitality. Everything about this evening was special.
Of course for me... the best was my ""Simple... Easy"" Spaghetti and Mussels. ""Spaghetti alle Vongole"". Spaghetti with local white Manilla Clams in the shell, white wine, lemon and garlic. OMG you gracious food gods..... it was absolutely the best pasta and clams I have ever tasted. The homemade spaghetti perfect. The wine sauce incredible... the finish I'm sure was a great olive oil... and while they don't serve anything at the table with butter.. I thought there might be a little butter in the final stages. The lemon and garlic were distinct... and bold but not sharp or harsh. You can tell I liked it! The Star.... the Clams.. and plenty of them.... steamed perfectly... tender moist tasty little bites.... surrounded by the sauce and perfect pasta.... Hell I have seen Food Heaven.
Oh yeh.... Great wine selection... and excellent variety of Bourbons and Ryes. What's not to love. Can't wait till we visit again.... wish we didn't live 1200 miles away."

We met the owner who is a friendly Italian man, and found out the name of the restaurant is named after his son Primo, which was pretty cute. The restaurant is colorful and cozy, the service was great, and the food was delicious. I ordered the spaghetti ai frutti di Mare- the tomato sauce was perfect and the seafood and clams tasted very fresh. My boyfriend had the wild boar and he enjoyed his as well. The best part of the dinner was the dessert- the tiramisu! It was just the right amount of cream and sweetness without becoming overwhelming. I definitely recommend the tiramisu here!"

Unfortunately the service was horrible!!! Arrived and had the choice in seating, the place was empty. Menus were dropped off and from that point on didn't get much attention. By the end of dinner the check was slightly tossed on the table and the waitress/owner walked away! She didn't even speak to us?!? Not sure I would recommend this place before giving it a go one more time, maybe she was having an off night?
The owner (gentleman) is such a pleasant and gracious man. His greeting was warm and inviting. I learned he is also the chef which makes sense why the food is delish; his kindness and generosity definitely spill over into his cooking."

I wasn't a fan of the bread and oil/vinegar that came with. We ordered the bistecca calabrese (prime ribs) with grilled asparagus and Spaghetti al forno (baked spaghetti).
I ordered the bistecca calabrese medium rare. Delicious! One of the best steak I've ever ate. I didn't need any steak sauce. Mixed well with red wine.
The spaghetti al farno tastes like any ordinary baked spaghetti at multiple restaurants. For tonight's dinner, I recommend the bistecca calabrese. The bread didn't impressed me much and price is really high. It was a good ""treating"" yourself out to eat types of restaurant but not eating here regularly."

Every single dish we had was sublime. I would particularly recommend the chicken that is their house specialty. Very delicious and flavorful. All the food was incredibly fresh and extremely well prepared. From the outside it may not be much to behold, but they've done a very good job of creating a nice ambience inside.

"Osteria Da Primo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-da-primo-burien?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff D.","We have lived in Des Moines for 22 and just found this place. It will now definitely be a go to place for us. Everything was great! The only thing I could say for improvement is they give you so much calamari on the order you might run out of the yummy aioli, not that you really need it, it's great all on its own; well seasoned. Best calamari we've ever had! And the bread is very good, might be a bit better if slightly warmed. The salads were great, in fact the Insalata Primo is great with some calamari added; the lemon vinagarette goes well with the calamari (I know cheese and seafood shouldn't mix).
On the surface it may seem to be higher priced than the surrounding area, but they have good sized portions and much better food than most in the area. They offer the full multi-course Italian meal, though unless you are sharing the pasta and main course I don't know how you could make it to dessert?! We stopped at pasta and got tsiramasu to bring home. My wife had mushroom and pancetta gnocchi and said that the gnocchi was ""life changing"". I had the spaghetti with seafood; some places you get a very little seafood. I had 5-6 huge shrimp, a dozen steamer clams and 1-2 Calamari, all perfectly cooked and combined in a great tomato sauce!
Most of the reviews are very positive, the only few negative ones I've seen are about service. I give no credibility to those. Its a small place, not much staff, I could see a very needy/demanding diner feeling ignored when they are busy. You will get good polite service and have the best Italian food in the area so give it a try you won't be disappointed."

So disappointed today only me and another couple of people and At the pizza place and my food was burnt
Such indigestion

But I threw out 34 dollars
People were very nice but I just ran out of there"
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alyssa T.","The food was great, freshly cooked with ingredients that weren't processed. The pizza we got had the sausage in it and the flavors blended well together without being overly salty or greasy like most pizzas. I actually enjoyed the thin crust and one pizza was enough to share with my boyfriend and I but it doesn't make you completely full. The environment seemed professional, almost too serious.
Definitely more of a place to go to when you're feeling fancy or going on a date. The seating is more intimate so it'd be perfect to have conversations. Not that great for bigger parties like my friends and I. The experience was fun but the pizza itself wasn't anything different from Blaze Pizza or some other non-chain pizza place.
You aren't missing much if you skip out on this place."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Florence Y.","Really good!
We ordered take-out here, as we wanted to eat in the hotel. The pizza was done in about 15 minutes--perfect, as we walked to the restaurant.
Although we didn't experience much of the service, the front desk girl was friendly and added in little packs of parmesan and pepper for us.
We ordered the sweet fennel sausage pizza. We ate this pizza cold, mind you, as we had made several other errands before we actually settled down and took our first bites. I wonder what it would've been like to eat their pizza hot and fresh out of the oven, as it was still amazing after it had been out in the cold weather for 20 or so minutes. There was good proportioning--I wasn't overwhelmed with the meat, which is something I hate. It wasn't too saucy. The crust was nice and thin (and crispy!)
We also got a slice of the coconut cream pie. This was good too--nice and creamy. The crust had coconut in it too, I believe and that was a really nice touch. The only thing is that the crust wasn't as flaky as I would've liked and the cream felt a little heavy and left my mouth feeling oily after a few bites. This is definitely a pie in which I'd share--I wouldn't eat a whole slice by myself.
I would definitely come here again (and hopefully eat-in next time), so I can try more of their menu."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katie C.","4.5 stars!
TLDR crispy, thin crust pizza with quality ingredients that you can taste! Definitely a pizza place I'd splurge on again at some point. The pizzas run about $25 with the 20% service charge and are individual sized.
Service:
Very good service, so it definitely earns that 20% service charge even when eating solo. I never felt ignored and my waiter checked on me just often enough for my water refill and for the check. He was also very helpful with which pizza to choose.
Location:
Pretty small, shared table arrangement with other groups. Turn over rate is pretty quick considering it's a pizza place. Nice, cozy, pizza smelling, no complaints from me! Try to walk if you can because it looked hard to find parking! In fact, a family left their car in the middle of the road with the emergency lights on just for the family to get out to wait in line (not that I approve of it).
Food: where -1 star
Very tasty, I liked both the special and the egg pizza. I enjoyed the layers of flavors - lemony, bitter arugula; salty meat; savory, creamy egg. One thing I didn't like about the pizza was that the toppings came off with one bite but maybe it can be solved with putting more force into the knife? It was really hard to enjoy toppings in every bite, but not too much of a complaint since the crust was soooo good too."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julian S.","It goes without saying that Tom Douglas has an enormous influence on the Seattle restaurant scene, so naturally this place was recommended to me by many people.
I ordered the clam pie which came with penn cove clams, pancetta tesa, and lemon thyme. The pizza was very balanced with the briny taste of the clams, the crispness of the crust and the rich umami of the pancetta tesa, and a bit of acidity from the lemon. The crust was more cracker than bread and the pizza itself seemed more flatbread than a pizza. Honestly, the crust is about the same as a MOD Pizza cooked ""well-done."" The pizza is extremely light, and if you're a big eater like me, you won't feel satisfied with one pie.
Service was attentive, although it did take a fair amount of time to get the pies out. Taste is definitely 4 stars but for $20, the value is a bit questionable. More than half the surface area of the pie is just bread without toppings. They also charge a mandatory 20% service charge in lieu of a tip. I like the spirit of this policy, but 20% is too high in my opinion. I was always taught that 15% is standard for service, and anything above is for exceptional service or large parties.
Pro Tip: Go here for an expensed work lunch, but not on your own.
TL;DR: decent pie, questionable value, attentive servIce"
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sharon T.","I was on a trip to Seattle and decided to stop by Serious Pie since it was recommended by a friend and they had 4k reviews. It was a lot smaller, cozier, unassuming than I had expected.
Pizzas are good. I usually leave my crusts uneaten but this crust was very crispy, flavorful and a good ending to the toppings. Each pizza was large enough for 1.5 persons or a very hungry person. We ordered 3 pizza among 4 people and that was more than enough. This is listed from my favorite to least favorite (all still good):
1. seasonal mushroom/truffle cheese
2. sweet fennel sausage/provolone
3. soft egg/proscuitto/arugula
At about 15-20$ per pizza, it is slightly overvalued. It is in a big downtown location so that may be why. I liked it but I don't think I would recommend coming to Seattle specifically to eat this."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sanoj T.","penn cove clams, pancetta tesa, lemon thyme - Every now and then, you go to a pizza joint but don't want the traditional marinara and mozzarella. This dish has that delicious flavor adjustment. The clams were the star flavor, with the pancetta tesa's fresh taste complimenting the clam, all accented by the thyme lemon (although the lemon was only slightly noticeable). The crust - perfectly crispy and chewy in the right spots - seemed to be seasoned deliberately to match the seaside flavor profile. Sometimes pizzas are exactly what you would expect; this time, I found myself wishing I was on the beach with friends and sharing this pizza.

Just the place itself, it's super cozy and modern. I would totally recommend coming here for a date. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for dinner the night before his birthday. We had heard great things about it so of course, being the food enthusiasts that we are, we had to check it out. The wait was short & once we were seated, we got a perfect little spot by the window.
Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. We were thankful for her honest recommendations when we asked for advice!
We got the Roasted Seasonal Mushroom pizza as well as the Buffalo Mozzarella pie! Both great, we honestly couldn't ask for more. Loved it!"

It is the cutest little place very understated outside and very quaint inside. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, add a community table. In Seattle, apparently there is a mandatory 20% tip that is already added to your check. So just FYI. The pizza here was the best pizza I have ever had in my life! I am originally from New York and pizza is very hard for me to like. We had the truffle pizza and the margarita pizza it was delicious! We had the beets, blueberries and pistachios for appetizer.
We had cannolis for dessert and they were not disappointing as well! The restrooms are locked with a code which they share very easily. Very light crust and small selection of pizzas but every single bite is tasty! You don't even need pepper flakes!

Serious Pie serves up a semi thin crust pizza that really hits the spot if you're craving artisan pizza.
The place is a little tiny so if you come during a busy time you're more than likely going to wait a bit.
My friends and I split a kale salad that wasn't anything special, but you know what they say, eat your veggies!
We also ordered the roasted seasonal mushroom, Crimini, truffle cheese pizza as well as the penn cove clam pizza. The mushroom pizza had a pretty decent flavor groove going on, but I'm not too sure I really vibed with it. Every bite just felt like something was lacking and for 20 bucks I think if I could have gone back, I'd order a second serving of the star of the show which is the pen cove clam pizza. This pizza was super delightful to eat and I found myself cheating a little and eating more of this pizza than the mushroom one. The clams didn't taste really fishy at all and had a really delicious taste. Out of everything I tried the penn cove clam pizza was the only thing I thought was worth it. Definitely would come back here for that pizza only"
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carol L.","Some of the most unique pizzas I've ever had! My family really loved their pizzas, but I personally wasn't the biggest fan because I generally don't like herbs. We got the Yukon gold potato, which I was really excited about because potato on a pizza was the ultimate carb overload. But the flavor of the rosemary felt too overpowering to the point where even scraping the herb off wasn't helping. We also got the sweet fennel sausage. Again, not a fan of herbs so I didn't really like the fennel, but this pizza was more palatable for me. In retrospect, if I had ordered the pizzas without the herbs, I would have loved them more. But I do think the herbs really help differentiate Serious Pie's pizzas from that of other restaurants. Food for me would have been 3 stars, but their service was great so I'm giving 4 stars. My family would give it 5 stars though!
The wait can be pretty long. So I recommend putting your name down and walking around the city. Dahlia Bakery is one street away so you can go grab a triple coconut cream pie before eating some pizza pies."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Karen Z.","I visited Serious Pie on a trip to Seattle a few years ago, and was super excited to try it again recently. It was even better than I remembered.
Serious Pie has a refreshing atmosphere. It's a nice restaurant--perfect for a date night or birthday--without being overly fancy. The staff are all nice and seem to enjoy being there. I like how the tip is pre-included in the bill to support the staff, and I really wish that more places did this.
The pizza here is awesome. The crust is thin without being burnt, and the ingredients are fresh and interesting. I'm not normally a big fan of thin crust pizza, but Serious Pie does a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend splitting multiple pizzas with friends, so that you can try as many flavors as possible."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tara L.","Came here with a group of 14 people and only had to wait about 15-20 minutes around lunch time, which isn't bad. We were able to to get seated in their back room which was nice and spacious.
With our amount of people, we decided to just order several different pizzas and share. I had the opportunity to try the Margherita pizza and their potato and rosemary pizza. Both of the pizzas had good flavor. I personally think that the pizzas themselves are just okay. I think it's the style of pizza because they come out in an oval shape and each slice is very thin. Their crust style is the burnt firewood type of pizza, which isn't my favorite. I'm definitely more of a classic triangle NY pizza style person. All in all, I'd probably come back for HH since you can get half a pizza for $7 which is a great deal."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tiffany L.","I seriously love this place and it is seriously worth the wait. I've been here twice now and I have yet to leave disappointed. The service is great and omg can we talk about the fooood! The clam pizza is amazing (who would have thought to put clams on a pizza?!). There is so much flavor and depth to the pizza here, the crust is cooked to perfection with just the right amount of char.
The salads are also very delicious. The kale salad is our favorite - tons of flavor but you can't go wrong with the butter lettuce too, I think it's a cesar type of dressing on it. We ordered the melon with prosciutto ""salad"" this time and that was also very tasty - didn't realize melon and meat could pair so well!
Order a side of the marina as well, you won't be disappointed as you're scraping the last bits off the ramkin with your pizza crust."

They gave my friend a free coconut cream dessert for her birthday, although we didn't eat much if it because nobody really liked coconut."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joanne C.","Visited this wonderful little joint while I visited Seatle. Heard it was one of the best pizza places around so I got to try! These people are busy! No reservations, so you better be prepared to wait. They will take your number so you can walk around the shopping center and local shops if you wish. They called us back about 45 minutes on a busy Saturday evening.
The place is a bit tiny, but that also means you get a good view of the chefs preparing your pizza, which is pretty cool Nice decor as well.
The food is super delicious. We only ordered pizza since that is what they are known for and the pizza is about the same price as their appetizers, so its a better deal. We got the sweet fennel sausage and roasted seasonal mushrooms. Both were good, but we definitely preferred the sweet fennel sausage more.
One thing though, we noticed this may have just been a Seatle thing but they automatically charge you a 20% tip on your bill. No biggy, service was decent, but just something to be aware of.
I will definitely be back whenever I am back in Seatle."

The pizza is incredible. The crust is just the right thickness and the toppings are killed. We tried a potato pizza as well as a sausage pizza. Loved them both. We had a small salad to start that was simple but good. Going to have to come back to try the rest!
The restaurant is located just a few blocks from Pike Place market. It's perfect if you're out exploring downtown or visiting as a tourist. Might as well have the best pizza in Seattle while you're here!
The restaurant is small, but nice. The decor is cool and it has a modern, warm vibe. Our waitress was really kind and the bathrooms were clean.
I will say that the wait can be long and the pizza is a little expensive, but both are totally worth it for the amazing taste. It's not the place if you're looking for simple takeout or a quick bite, but it's perfect for a date night or weekend.
Love this place!"

Kinda speedy for a lunch outing; $17-$20. Pizzas are oval and feed 1-2. The average sized guy powered down a while pizza."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alice L.","Awesome pizza place. I've been meaning to try Serious Pie every time I visit Seattle so I made it a point to go this time around. It's walking distance from Pike Place so if you're out of town and staying in downtown Seattle, I highly recommend giving it a try. It gets pretty busy since the restaurant's not very big so you'll most likely have to wait during prime lunch/dinner hours. I ordered the sweet fennel sausage pizza ($19) and it was delicious. Probably one of the best pizzas I've had. It only has sausage, cheese, and roasted peppers, but wow, so tasty for something so simple. It's a little pricey since I was able to eat the entire thing myself, but it looks like they have a weekday happy hour so I'll definitely check that out the next time I'm in Seattle."
"Serious Pie","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Edward W.","We ordered takeout over the phone and it was easy to pick up.
These pizzas are more artisan style.
The mushroom truffle pizza was the best since they use juicy mushrooms and the truffle wasn't overpowering. Crust was incredible fluffy as well.
Buffalo mozzarella pizza reminded me more of a margherita style and it was pretty good.
Each pizza is roughly a personal size although we were starving so split 3 pizzas among 2 people. One downside of takeout is the pizza isn't as hot when you eat it."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carolyn P.","Such a cool place for brunch! I love restaurants that really deliver on a novel menu and Nue is one of those. We grabbed a reservation for a Sunday morning. Can I get a high five for actually having the option to reserve a table on a weekend morning?!
The food was out quick and it was incredibly delicious. It was so hard to choose from the diverse menu so we'll have to be back. The shakshuka is awesome and you should grab a slice of coconut corn bread too.
One note: This place is loud -- open kitchen, industrial ceiling, communal tables, so not ideal for an intimate affair. But if you're hanging with friends and don't mind rubbing elbows with strangers, head on over!"
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jason P.","Booked a reservation with Nue to celebrate my birthday. Our group was 16 and they were able to flawlessly accommodate us.
The pros:
Great, diverse set of foods from various parts of the world. Everything was bursting with flavor. My favorite by far has to be the Chapli kabobs. Adding the little mix they include (Indian snack mix) really adds a great complementing flavor to the dish. The portion sizes justifies the prices that you see on the menu. The bunny chow was an awesome dish with great flavor and the chicken was cooked well. A few at our table for the Malaysian vegetarian dish and they really enjoyed it. The 'Trinidadian Doubles' are very similar to an Indian dish called Poori & Channa Masala.
Drinks were pretty good, however we did have to send one back because it tasted like they skimped on the alcohol just a tad.
Cons:
For celebrating ones birthday, you'd think the restaurant would have made at least a small gesture to acknowledge the event as to why everyone was celebrating and why such a big group was out to eat. I had emailed the owners to request the reservation so I am surprised even they did not have any appreciation or thoughts of celebration that we chose their venue to host and spend $600+ on a Thursday night for a meal. The lack of customer service on that front reduces my desire to return. Nothing wrong with the cuisine. The food is awesome, period."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Abhijit S.","Good:
- Lively ambience.
- Eclectic and very tasty food.
Not so good:
- Community seating, meaning you'll share a table with strangers. I've seen this at some other joints too, but here, there's very little personal space among parties. Depending on who you're sitting beside, this can be an annoyance. My friend and I were sat adjacent to a group who clearly work together. How do I know? Because they were obnoxiously loud and inconsiderate of others.
- Servers not very attentive; no one refilled our water bottle.
- Not all servers are friendly. I asked for a clean plate for the 2nd item we ordered, and the server seemed reluctant in doing that.
- Price is slightly on the higher side. But that's not unexpected from a popular eatery in Seattle.
I'd go again."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ha T.","They do have a pretty exciting weekend brunch menu, with dishes from all six continents and mix of different cultures. It's gimmicky, but effective.
I like their spin on the chicken and waffle. Fish sauce chicken wings have always been good with rice at home. I never knew it could go so well with maple syrup and waffle. They keep the batter light and don't hold back on the fish sauce, so cheers to them.
I'm disappointed in the bunny chow. The chicken is overcooked and not tender at all. The curry mix tastes strange; it doesn't have much warmth or aroma, and adding fresh tomato doesn't help. The bread holding the curry is tough. So is the fries.
So, brunch is kind of a mixed-bag. I'm waffling between three and four stars. The fish sauce wings prevail, so a grudging four stars it is."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lois C.","Wow! Hands down one of the favorite restaurant my husband and I visited this year. This place has been bookmarked for so long, I don't know what took me this long. We visited on a friday night around 4:45, and we lucked out with our seats. As the night went on, the store was quickly filled. We ordered the tower wings, Japanese katsu sandwich, and fries.
All our foods came out pretty quickly and everything was amazing. All the flavors were definitely not expected. The wings were probably the best I have ever had! Sweet, spicy, and savory all at the same time was unbelievable. It had a very unique sweet fish sauce and it was nothing that I have ever had. The fries had some sort of peanut mayo sauce(?) which was surprisingly one of the best combinations.
If you couldnt tell already, I loved Nue, and I will definitely will be coming back for more! The only downside for me is the seating here. This is not a typical restaurant with small two people seatings available. There are only big tables which will make you sit with strangers. But food so good, its worth it."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Daisy I.","Nue is now one of my local favorites for international cuisine. Everything I've tried here is just delicious. My favorite is the acaraje, taste just like the akara from West Africa plus some seafood. The ribs, wings, and curries are also really good! The plates are mostly shareable style with the exception of the curries. The malva pudding didn't taste as great as some I've had at other places but was still pretty good.
The style of the restaurant is also very eclectic. Space isn't very big inside so its better for small or medium size groups. Also be sure to make a reservation as its very popular!"

"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James T.","I nue it from the get-go that this place will deliver a unique dining experience!
We made reservations but the place accepts walk-ins as well. There are limited indoor seatings. They can accomodate up to 24 people at the 2 communal tables, 4-6 people on window counter, and roughly 8-10 people at the bar. Be prepared to be packed in like sardines if the place gets busy.
As I walked in, I couldn't help but peruse the eye-catching memorabilia from different countries being put on display. Lovely!
We ordered:
*South African Bunny Chow
Hold your horses! Contrary to the name, it's not a dish made of sweet little bunnies but rather chicken curry served in a pullman bread bowl. Curry was aromatic, chicken was tender, and bread bowl was perfectly toasted. Love it!
*Balinese Barbequed Spare Ribs
I grew up eating Balinese style spare ribs and this ain't it. The glaze used for this ribs is a different type of glaze Balinese use on grilled fish. The overall flavor was alright but just didn't sit well with us who are so used to the authentic Balinese ribs. Priced at $35, I wouldn't get it again.
*Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings
Not only did they look good, but they also tasted AMAZE-WING! They were bold with nice sweet peppery kick. My only gripe was that on two of the pieces that I had, the meat was slightly tough but the rest of them was juicy and tender.
*South African Chocolate Malva
Baked pudding bathed in warm chocolate sauce and topped with coffee liqueur whipped cream. The texture was slightly spongy like cake but also delicate like pudding. Chocolate sauce was decadent but not too overwhelming. The whipped cream was surprisingly very light and flavorful. Overall, just WOW. It was my first encounter with this dessert and it certainly won't be the last!
Service was friendly and accommodating. Food took quite a while to come out but understandable since it was a busy night. All in all, would return to try other dishes!"
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ting A.","Definitely make a reservation if coming during peak hours. Fortunately I had made one a couple of days in advance at noon as no open seats were available until close to 1 PM.
Inside is dimly lit and crowded due to the small space. I ended up being squished between two parties on a long table. Their dishes are pricey for the amount of food served, but are rather special in its flavors.
-----
Tower of Chengdu Wings: double-dipped, crispy fried wings and drumsticks with green Szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, lime, chili, basil, Thai chili, and mint ($18).
The tower came with a stack of freshly fried 3 chicken wings and 3 drumsticks. The sour smell was unexpected, but the combination of the spiciness, sweetness, and sourness was tasty. I also liked how well the basil and sauce paired with the chicken! And it isn't hot unless you decide to eat the sliced Thai chili peppers.
If coming for dinner, this dish is instead listed on the menu as ""Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings"" for the same price. A bowl for discarding bones as well as two wet wipes are provided.

"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Semuteh F.","Perfection.
Avoided the wait by sitting at the bar and our party of four was seated immediately. We ordered a bit of everything- cornbread, kebabs, curry, hot wings, and kale salad. The restaurant theme is global street food and we tried dishes from Jamaica, Pakistan, Syria, Malaysia and Thailand. Food was delicious and the service at the bar was exceptional! Love the vibes and the food!
They mostly take reservations and we were initially told when we arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night that we could come back in three hours or hope one of their reservations canceled (?!?!). The thing is, there were a ton of empty tables! As we are leaving the host then suggests the bar which has four empty seats available immediately which we happily took. Throughout our meal we noticed that most of the restaurant was sitting empty waiting on reservations. Their system isn't working so they really should keep a couple tables open for walk-ins."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ron V.","What can I say?? Best wings ever! Seriously. I can't think of any other place I've been to that even came close to their wings. I also liked the ambience, communal dining at its best."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sunny P.","Perfect brunch spot that offers an Asian-American twist! I came with a friend on a Sunday at around 2PM. Surprisingly, there were no lines and we were seated right away. There are seats by the window bar, bar seatings, and two one-table (sharing) tables. We chose to sit on one of the one tables closest so the beautiful decorations. We were given ample amount of time to choose and browse through the menu. We got the recommended Sunny Bunny, Chicken & Waffles, and the Cornbread. My friend and I loved the Sunny Bunny, which was curry served with half loaf toast and sunny side egg. I never had curry with bread before, and it was delicious. The curry was rich and very memorable. The chicken & waffles were delicious as well. We were both disappointed with the cornbread, however. We read amazing reviews on it, but unfortunately, it was too stale and too unflavored. It seemed like they were trying to make the syrup served on the side to accommodate the taste, but it was just too sweet with the coconut sprinkled on top of the cornbread. I would skip on it and instead go for another side dish if I were to come back!"
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael P.","Where do you go when it's 1:30 pm and you haven't eaten yet? Brunch at Nue! This chicken and waffle dish with an Asian twist is serious business... It disappeared way too fast. It's got a nice spicy kick to it that's complemented very nicely with the seasoning on the chicken and the sweetness of the syrup. The Filipino fried rice dish was something I'll never say no to. Comfort food? Buttery fried rice with eggs and pork? Say no more. Get in my stomach.
1. Chengdu Chicken and Waffles: Nue's Signature Chengdu Fried Chicken Wings with green Szechuan peppercorn, fish sauce, lime, chili, basil, mint, Thai chili served with real maple syrup and a waffle
2. Filipino Tosilog: house made tocino (cured pork), sinangag garlic, scallion, fried rice, soy & chili vinegar, two sunny-side up eggs
Tongue? Blessed."

Wasn't a fan of the Chengdu Wings, it tasted like a cross between honey wings and unseasoned meat. The sweet sauce was too sweet and rich maling the bland wings difficult to enjoy.
The Filipino dish was decent. 4 stars for the cornbread."

We went at an odd time around 2:30 so it was pretty empty and we got seated right away! The service was great and the food came out so quick! We were so hungry, we devoured our food hahaha
We tried the Tower of Chengdu Wings, Israeli Shakshuka, and the Malaysian curry. My favorite dish out of the three surprisingly was the Shakshouka! It was the best one I've had compared to many other places! Also the roti that came out with the curry was perfection! So much goodness, it was soft, crispy, chewy, and buttery, mmm yum :) Wish the wings were a little bit less sweet. But it was really good otherwise.
I want to try all of their other plates, everything sounded really good. It's a small cozy restaurant with interesting decor. Can't wait to come back here for more delicious food and some drinks."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Salena C.","Possibly our single most favorite restaurant in Seattle! The creativity at Nue is unbeaten; flavor and presentation are 10/10 for sure!
The inside of the restaurant is small, though if it is a nice day they do offer outdoor seating as well, which helps! Courses are meant for sharing, so it's a great way to sample a lot of the menu. They pace the plates well, never letting you sit with nothing for long, though also not bombarding you with 10 dishes at a time.
My husband still talks about Nue even though we've been home for weeks, so you KNOW it's great!"

Between the fun food, eccletic vibe, and the bottomless mimosas, we had a great time. The food was interesting and tasty. Was anything mind-blowing? Not necessarily. But everything was solid. Price-wise, it's a bit much for what it is, but I guess that's Seattle now-a-days."
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sebastian T.","This is an interesting spot to say the least: the interior is wonderfully decorated with all sorts of interesting things that'd make you do a double take constantly, and the food features speciality dishes from various ethnicities from all over the world! (thai water beetles for example). It does get pretty busy here, so I recommend reservations especially during peak hours.
The ambience feels like a relaxed upscale bar/eatery, and the service was great! You'll find dishes at a slightly higher price point while the portions arent lacking. Their menu actually rotates so its always fun coming back to see what other things are on the menu.
I've been back a few times and I've always left satisfied! I highly recommend checking this spot out, and it even doubles as a great date spot - there are other spots nearby to check out to keep the day going!"
"Nue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nue-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tigger H.","We decided to try a new place for brunch and it is genuinely one of the most ""Seattle"" places I've ever been. I was a little surprised by the wide range of cultural dishes but we tried the things we confuse the most. Both of us were happily surprised with our tasty food! It was a pretty slow time, I think we were too early for the lunch rush so we had a lot of help from the staff and everyone was very kind to us. I loooove peanut sauce in all forms and putting them on fries and pairing with crispy Brussels is GENIUS. I had the bunny chow which was way more food than I needed but super fun to try! We ended our meal with the pineapple coconut cornbread and hollyyyyyyyy stars it was such a treat. I think we're going to go back just to buy a pan of that stuff!
The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it's not quite a traditional brunch place, which is how it's advertised. Not much breakfast food on the menu."

There's often a lot of people waiting when we pass and worried we wouldn't get a table for 5 on a Saturday night at 7, but we squeezed into a 4 top and skipped the 45 min wait.
The kids menu came with fresh crayons (yay no germs!) but I had to deduct a star for the kids fish and chips only coming with one piece of fish and it being expensive for a kid's menu.
I opted for the magic mai thai and it helped me escape the winter here for an hour, haha! It tasted like the islands mon! They spin a wheel and offer a drink special based on it, so my husband got the $4 vodka martini!
I had the original Mac and cheese that I split with one of my kids. It was plenty of food and great! My husband had the wings and RAVED about them. Service was quick and the place was loud and fun!
Edited: stars gone because everyone that ate the fish and chips are violently ill now.

And the kitchen messed it up and did the opposite.
When I see pink or blood in my food it makes me sick and ruins my appetite. I can't eat anything.

FOOD: I ended up ordering the salmon fish and chips plate. I was a little leery to try this at first because I had never had salmon fish and chips before. To my surprise it was one of the most delicious meals that I have had in a long time. The fish was cooked just perfectly and the fries were dangerously tasteful. I debated on coming back the next day, but our schedule kept us from doing that. I would highly recommend this plate to anyone who loves salmon. My only wish is that you got more fish for the plate, but it was still great nonetheless.
SERVICE: The service here was great. We came in when it wasn't too busy, but our server was extremely friendly and helpful with choosing meals. They were also really attentive. I didn't experience any issues while eating here.
OVERALL: this is a fantastic restaurant overall that offers a wide variety of menu options. The two different plates we had were both very enjoyable and comparable for the price. The service was also fantastic and I would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a bite to eat in Seattle."

Their sour dough pastas are very popular. We opted to share one hearty dish which was super filling and flavorful. We tried the Northwest wild salmon, San Juan Island mushrooms with asiago cream sour dough pasta. It was a heavenly bowl of hearty holiday like comfort food goodness. We're generally not big fan's of heavy cream sauces and prefer zesty, spicy red sauces, so I'm glad we listened to our server's suggestion and tried it out.
We were there during busy happy hour time, and service was a still timely and attentive. This would be a great place to hang out with friends, especially during happy hour!"

Every course was delicious! The sourdough is all homemade. Sourdough mac and cheese was the perfect pairing of mac and cheese with a bite. The sourdough bread was sink your teeth in delicious, we ordered TWO of the Whole Milk Fresh Mozzarella
Spread with Our Sourdough Baguette and wish we could have gotten a couple to do. It was amazing with the pesto almond sauce to dip the mozzarella in before putting on the bread. I had the Alaskan Cod Tacos which had an amazing avocado salsa on it that really added some spice to the delicious crunch of the fried cod. My husband had the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Bacon Jam Burger and it was the perfect pairing of caramelized onions, jam bacon and yummy burger on a fresh, soft brioche bun! Friends had the Sourdough Mac & cheese, the Goucho Pizza, Hass Avocado and Billionaire's Bacon Hamburger and the Seattle Sourdough Wild Fish & Chips. They all raved about their meals. Everyone loved the scratch made drinks and nice selection of beer. The restaurant was a nice little bar with a dining room in the back. It can get rather loud with the kitchen and bar being located right next to each other, but they have a great little room in the back. I will be back to Von's. I loved the atmosphere, the food was amazing and the service was wonderful. Our waitress even brought my friend a scoop of an amazing coconut, cherry chocolate sorbet (house made of course) with a sparkler! We all shared that for dessert and popped over to Fran's for some leftover Holiday specials. I wholeheartedly recommend going to Von's. I'll be having a get together there in the near future after trying that amazing. Fresh Mozzarella on homemade bread. I can practically taste it just writing this review! Yumm!"

Stayed in the financial district with a toddler and needed a family friendly place to eat and our concierge recommended Von's.
This place was amazing! It started with the friendly staff and everyone was smiling and greeting us there even though the front of the restaurant was packed. The restaurant is bigger than it looks.
We were seated immediately at 6:30 pm and there were a couple of tables left. Most of the patrons look to be professionals who stop in after work or couples coming out for a nice dinner. They were accommodating for our toddler and high chairs available and brought crayons and a coloring placemat/menu.
Our table host informed us they are known for their pizzas and pasta so we ordered one of each, olives as appetizers and a house salad.
Olives were tasty and nice portion size for $6. Side salad was fresh and sharable. Pasta was AMAZING! I loved my NW Salmin pasta the most. The sourdough pasta was incredible!!
The sauce is creamy and the salmon was delishes. Large portion- enough to share with my kid, and I was still stuffed.
The pizza was great but my pasta really knocked it out of the park. I would love to eat this again next time we are in Seattle.
The atmosphere is light with a lot of laughters, casual but formal enough for a nice date night. Very happy with our dinner here and highly recommend."
"Von’s 1000 Spirits","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vons-1000-spirits-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Derek H.","I don't know what took me so long to try out Von's, but I'm kicking myself for it. I think I've found the best burger in the city here.
WAIT
It can get busy, especially given its prime location downtown and right next to the market for tourists. We had a 25 minute wait without a reservation on a Thursday night for 3.
AMBIANCE
Very Americana. Von's prides itself on its liquor, as its name suggests, but also on its sourdough that's turned into pasta, buns, you name it. The bar is really long, and the decor is fitting. The huge drink roulette on the wall is a nice touch. Service was standard, friendly and efficient.
FOOD
I went with the 10 oz Classic Burger, and I'm so happy I did. The burger had the thick ""gourmet"" restaurant style patty that I usually don't prefer over a smashed patty (a la Shake Shack), but Von's did the thick patty justice. They were able to retain the juices of the meat and keep the pink in the middle which is harder to come by than you'd think. The accouterments in the Classic honestly pair so well. The pickle slices were the MVP of the burger. The perfect brine and bite to counteract the huge juicy patty allowed for a super balanced bite. I didn't feel the need to wash down any bites.
The Cod Fish and Chips were okay. I'm not a huge fish and chips guy, but I liked how it wasn't overly battered. Their fries are pretty solid. Maybe a little on the oily side.
The cocktail was alright. It's more for the experience than anything. It came out in a hula skirt dressed glass with a sparkler attached to it. Bottle service for $15?
OVERALL
Great spot, great location. It's a little pricier ($19 for the burger and fries before tax and grat), but I think it's well worth it. I need to come back to try the other burgers and the confit fries."

Came here with my team for lunch at 11am on a Friday. The restaurant is pretty big and had plenty of space (though it started to get full around 12pm).
Food: delicious! I'm happy this is an option around the area at a great price - esp for WA residents with a whopping 25% discount. I had the salmon salad and it was delicious, packed with toppings, and I especially liked their pickled cabbage and roasted cauliflowers in the salad. Really really good. My coworker ordered a salad topped with chicken which she said was her favorite salad she's had in a while, and my other coworker had the Mac and cheese and loved it. All goes to say, food is good.
Ambiance is great. A little loud with the music but cozy enough to not have to scream yet be comfortable. Great lunch spot.
Service was spectacular. Our waitress was on top of it.

"Von’s 1000 Spirits","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vons-1000-spirits-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Camille W.","Happy my friend and I decided to go for this restaurant, it is usually pretty dang busy, fortunately that wasn't the case when we stopped in for happy hour on a Monday afternoon around 4pm. I highly suggest going around early HH as the restaurant fills up quickly - being that it's so close to Pike's Place Market, the hub of tourists.
From what I could tell, every 30 minutes, one of the employees rotates this wheel at the front and back of the restaurant that shows an alcoholic beverage with a price point and that is the deal of the hour. For our orders, we got such refreshing cocktails! Mine was a bourbon citrusy drink called Blood Orange Bourbon Punch - $10 HH, and my friend the Bramble, which is a blackberry, lemon based gin cocktail - $7 HH.
As far as food goes, we were able to stick with HH options cause they had great options! My friend got the clams with the tomato based sauce ($10) and a side of sourdough bread! I tried a bit of the sauce and was super impressed, a little kick at the end. She mentioned that the shellfish were also good, no gritty-ness to them. I chose the mushroom sourdough pizza and that is one of my favorite pizzas I've ever had. Big fan of mushroom pizzas, but the sourdough crust was an added plus! The portion was a regular solo pizza size, but I brought a couple slices home ($15).
All in all, our experience for HH was memorable and believe that Von's is one of Seattle's best spots for a great cocktail and unique takes on classic American eats!"

We ordered the Cuban sandwich, wings and side salad. Now that side salad was the shit. The vinaigrette and sunflower seeds were on point. The wings were good ...the Cuban was good but avocado spread was unexpected (and unnecessary).
If back near Pike Market would go back. This place is has an awesome patio and drinks specials were legit."
"Von’s 1000 Spirits","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vons-1000-spirits-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Kat K.","I had a really good time here several days ago. Huge thanks to the host who found a table for 5 at such a short notice! It was packed, and yet we got a nice spot at the back of the restaurant where we stayed put for a cozy couple of hours.
Since we were a group, we ordered and tried a bunch of stuff. My personal favourites were the Harvest Old Fashioned and Dram & Pear cocktails - they were so smooth; not too sweet, but the bite of alcohol wasn't that sharp either.
When it comes to food, the mac & cheese tasted a little odd, but the spicy fennel meatballs, cod tacos and white pizza were really good! They came in fast too, and portions were big enough to share among 5. I didn't get to try the Walla Walla burger, but I heard it tasted good, and the fries were crispy and delicious! For dessert, we had the sweet cream beignets and the baked apples, which were creamy and delicious as well.
I'm not sure about sitting at the front, it seemed packed and steamy, but I really liked the back of Von's and hope to get to sit there again. :)"

open a restaurant if we hit the lottery. So, sitting amidst the action is like double prizes for us. Oh, and the food was AMAZING. The sourdough crust pizza adds a subtle pizzazz that elevates their pies, nothing overpowering- just mmmm. We also split the cod fish and chips, and I can't think of anywhere that does it better. They made me a crazy good mocktail and had everything my hubby wanted from the bar. Super enjoyable, low key, great place that seems like a neighborhood joint, rather than a touristy trap. Happy to go back any time we can. (Sit by Ariel )"

II. Disclaimer: I have not been paid or compensated to write or share this review by anyone in any way, shape or form
III. The Food and The Drinks: This place prides itself as having the most extensive collection of Alcoholic Drinks in Seattle. We ordered a Variety of Japanese Whiskey, Rachel's Ginger Beer, Mojito Variations and Beer from the Special Menu. We also ordered grub including... (photos attached)
- Von's Wings: Overly Sweet. Will never order them again
- Sourdough with Pesto and Mozzarella: tasted ok
- Fennel Meatballs: Very small in size and very average in taste
- Frites with Pork Confit: Very Average
- Burgers and Fries: Pass
IV: Service and Ambience:
- This is one of those places where You get a mixed message. They claim to have the largest selection of Spirits in Seattle and yet they want to present themselves as a Gastropub.
- They are definitely serious about their booze but need to be serious about their food
- The music can get overbearingly loud that You can't hear the people at Your own table sometimes.
- The Service is consistent and efficient but You don't come here for the warm and fuzzies :)
V. Pricing: They have an ounce of 30 Year Old Macallan for $1,000.... The food was priced on the higher end of mid-range. For the 4 of us with all the selections shared above, we paid $146 and change"

FOOD:
1. Sourdough Pizza: Hot fennel sausage & black garlic ricotta 4/5: Chewy crust and really good toppings.
2. Seattle Smoked Salmon Mac: 4/5: really rich and decadent with the salmon. Large shell shaped noodles.
3. Oven roasted Cherry tomatoes, creamy chevre, in a basil almond pesto: 5/5: SOO GOOD AND loved the sundried tomatoes!!
UPDATE:
Came for lunch on a Friday and they're just as busy. There are spin-the-wheel drink discounts and the lunch menu is more burgers & fish/chips in addition to the sourdough pizzas. Salmon burger 5/5: brioche bun and slaw really made the burger! And it was a large piece of salmon too"

And, they have Eggplant Parmesan too! Am from the Northeast and miss the small mom/pop shops where you could get home-made quality deli and comfort food on almost every block. Zaccagni's is doing it right and their gravy (tomato sauce) is simple, light and flavorful. Quick, delicious food downtown for $10 or less, good stuff!"

The staff here is friendly and the food is always served hot and fresh when I pick it up.
There isn't much room to eat inside the restaurant, but there is a central outdoor food-court if you want to eat outside or you can just take-away as well.
The fries with gravy are a bargain."

Last week, I had 2 ppl visiting the office and suggested grabbing this spot for lunch, and they both loved it! They did say their sandwiches were on the messier side, but they both enjoyed them.
I ordered their special of the day, which was like a Chicken Club but with a twist. It had crispy onions and a great sauce that was on the lettuce in the sandwich. I want to say it was called a CBC or something. Anyways, it was amazing! I am not a huge sandwich fan either.
I have also tried their poutine, which is great as well! Average $10 lunch sandwich prices for the area."

I started to try other items on the menu from my norm of the roast pork or chicken parm. Glad I checked out the Braised Beef Brisket this time around, it was quite good & tasty! Super tender, moist in it's natural juices all served on Le Panier's wonderful bread, caramelized onions on that mofo too makes it even that much better. A good schmeer of horseradish to clear out your sinuses too. Very good and this may be my new go-to sandwich here.
As mentioned before, it's a small little shop, mainly take out, staff has always been nice & friendly, quick to work up your sandwich and priced pretty good for the size you get. They do have specials of the day and some new sandwiches they add to the chalk board wall, so be sure to check it out when coming in.
Napkins are your friend here, because it's pretty juicy and can get a little messy."

"Zaccagni’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaccagnis-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Kristine S.","A co-worker of mine raved about the sandwiches at this place, especially the meatball sub, and I love me a good meatball sub. I had to give it a shot today.
It's a tiny shop and I spent much of my time there standing around, wondering if the other people in there had already ordered or if there was a line. It turned out that I was the only person who hadn't ordered yet, but both employees were working on the line, putting together orders. When I did place my order, I wasn't given a number (the five or so people in front of me hadn't gotten one either) so when the lady called out a number and order, we had no idea whose order it was. We just tried to guess based on who got there when. It seems like there could be a better system in place so there isn't any confusion.
I have to agree with another reviewer that my sandwich was... fine. The bread was fresh, but the sauce was underspiced, and the meatballs, while tender, were bland and nothing really special.
Lunch in this neighborhood is usually about $10-12 and that's about what I paid today.
I don't think I'll go back."

I ordered the chicken parm sandwich with some hot peppers. I think the main reason I gave this 3 v 4 stars was that the bread they use was nothing really special (which in a sandwich...is kind of a big deal)"
"Zaccagni’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaccagnis-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Gav V.","The two sandwiches I had on two occasions were the chicken cutlet and meatballs sub. Maybe because I grew up and worked in a sub sandwich shop for 7 years (albeit, a franchise and now almost completely dead one), but I'll say this place probably has the most disappointing subs I can imagine. Bread is toasted, but tough'ish/cold'ish. And the sauces and meats are... subpar taste and quality-wise. The food just doesn't taste fresh for whatever reason (yes, I ate it on the spot both times!). I'm sorry to disagree with many of the raving reviews, but it just doesn't come anywhere close to its 4* rating."
"Zaccagni’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaccagnis-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Koby H.","It's hard to find homemade Italian sandwiches in this part of he country, but Zaccagni's and Tat's give me hope. I had the meatball sun, which featured homemade meatballs made earlier that morning by the woman at the counter. The complimentary pickled peppers and veggies really bring it home.
My only complaint, which I might follow up on: while I was there, that same woman said something off-color to her Spanish-speaking cook about needing to get him English classes. I hope they have a good relationship and that was an actual offer or friendly joke because it doesn't sit well with me."

Sauce was under spiced, bread was fresh and the meatballs seemed to be mediocre at best. Absolutely nothing bad here...just sadly nothing great either. I think if you are looking for a quick sandwich for under $12, this is as good of option in the banking district as any. I had low expectations going in...they were slightly beat."

Chef has an awesome menu with excellent ingredients and a style of play you don't find up here in the Northwest. Excellent portions to leave those hunger cravings at bay, the herb roasted pork sandwich is ""da bomb""! Friendly service, quick delivery with restaurant flare. Sandwiches are moist, plenty of flavor in seasonings, meats are well prepared with lots of smack your mouth flavor!

Suffice to say, the chicken parm did NOT disappoint. Easily one of the better chicken parms I've had, and I'm including all the ones I've had back from my years living in Boston. The chicken is perfectly fried, the sauce and cheese ratios are on point, and the sub roll is lightly toasted (that last piece is of particular importance to me).
I've since gone back to try the Italian sandwich, as well as the Meatball sub. Both were good, but not great--I've definitely had better back east--but still tasty sandwiches nonetheless.
I still need to try the brisket, which is next on the list for me. But that chicken parm will be hard to not order next time I go in!"
"Zaccagni’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaccagnis-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","A C.","Knocking them back a few stars, not because of food quality, but because online ordering has been unavailable for some time now. It's a LOT more efficient for those of us working downtown to order online and walk in to pick up as the food is ready.

"Varlamos Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/varlamos-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer B.","We really wanted to like this neighborhood place and wanted to support it...
We ordered a bunch of food - large pizza and two dishes between the two of us for take out. The person on the phone needed me to repeat the order many times. Maybe she was distracted. She was nice overall. She said it would be ready in 20 minutes but it was more like 30-40 minutes.
The eggplant parmesan was mealy in its consistency. The chicken parmesan wasn't much better. It came with two little spaghettis, which we didn't need and didn't taste great. The side salad had a ton of cheese on it that I ended up taking off and feeding it to my dog for the week. The pizza was too greasy, salty and cheesy. The food overall was too salty and cheesy. We like salt and cheese but this was too much for us. I think with a little tweaking the place could do better.
We long for a New Jersey style mom and pop Italian place like my partner grew up with but the search continues."
"Varlamos Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/varlamos-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Caitlin H.","I came here to try the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. My friend summed it up perfectly when he said, ""I can't tell if that's supposed to be ground beef or Italian sausage."" Steak, it's supposed to be steak. And when your steak tastes like a cross between ground beef and Italian sausage, that's a problem.
All of the cheese had melted off to one side of the sandwich. You couldn't taste the peppers or onions at all. The bread was super hard and crusty.
I didn't want the salad that was supposed to come with it. I didn't think to ask if I could substitute anything for it. I was kind of annoyed about paying $16.75 for a single sandwich, but that's partially my own fault.
The Philly cheesesteak here might be somebody's idea of a good sandwich, but it's definitely not what I was looking for."
"Varlamos Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/varlamos-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wendy K.","Stumbled upon this place in between shopping at uvillage and headed to City People we were going to grab a snack and beverage at JAKs but the weren't open till 4:30 and we were parked out front at 4 so we walked down the block when we saw Varlamos sign. We decided to sit at the bar you can tell it's very much a neighborhood go to we saw a family come in to get their mason jar of salad dressing by the interaction with the staff they seem to stop by often. The bartender who was also our server snd the main dining room was friendly.
They're in the middle of construction on the space next door which will be their bar instead of the small space they currently have in the restaurant but it's not disruptive at all you wouldn't even know.
One of the drink specials was Deep Eddy Pomegranate with I asked if I could have Ruby Red instead of the the Pomegranate and it was not a problem. I was pleasantly surprised when we received or drinks in highballs and even more so when I saw it only cost $7 a piece.
We were going to go with a couple of appetizers but decided to split a sandwich and the fried mozzarella instead pretty sure the sticks were house-made by the way they were coated We had the $15 Unconventional BLT: Bacon, Canadian-style bacon, chipotle mayo & mozzarella on French bread served up hot & finished with fresh, crisp lettuce & tomatoes. He brought is the salad split which was still generous servings per person. When he brought the sandwich out he have us a couple of smaller plate. the sandwich was gigantic so glad we split it we actually couldn't eat all of our halves. Bothe the mozzarella sticks and the sandwich came out piping hot. Anyone who knows me, knows I hate it when food comes out like it's been sitting around for awhile.
We had a great conversation with another lady sitting at the bar waiting for her husband. Would definitely make this a stop when I'm in the neighborhood looking for a great meal."
"Varlamos Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/varlamos-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rich D.","For reference purposes, I ordered a small BBQ pizza and the hot wings. These are items that I have ordered hundreds of times across the US throughout my years of business travels and this was by far the worst pizza and wings I have ever eaten. The hot wings were burnt and so dry that I could only compare them to what I would guess dog food to taste like. As for the BBQ pizza, it felt and tasted like a mash of non-identifiable ingredients with a sickly sweet after taste. Obviously, others have had good experiences with this restaurant based on their other reviews which is why I ordered from them but I cannot imagine those positive reviewers received the same items that I did, made the same way. Saying all that, I don't want to discourage you the reader from trying this place if you are really interested in checking it out but maybe just avoid the wings and bbq pizza"

The shrimp and calzone are also delicious and made well.
I would recommend this place for date night with your significant other or family and friends. The environment is perfect for romantic evenings and again or family.

If JC himself needed a last super, it would be at Varlamos. It is a classic neighborhood joint that changes just enough. Most menu items come with a salad. It's pretty standard for a salad (ask for olives if you are feeling up for it), but come here enough and you won't be able to get enough of it. Portions are good enough to take a portion home the next day. Entrée wise can't really go wrong with any of the pastas, the calzones fill you up and this pizza hits the spot.

Overall I prefer the style and cheese of Luciano's but I would come back here again. The mozzarella sticks were standard, as was the salad. The hummus was actually pretty good - super garlicky.

They load the pizza with toppings and put the meat under the cheese which I enjoy. I have had the terminator pizza (basically a gyro on pizza) and made my own three topping pizza. A small is big enough to share with two people, anything bigger and you'll have leftovers. The pizzas range from $10-23 depending on the size and the toppings.

They have delicious food, friendly and sociable staff, and its family friendly! If you're looking for somewhere to eat, consider trying Varlamos!"
"Varlamos Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/varlamos-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Abdullah A.","I lived just behind Varlamos for two years, and I wasn't the biggest fan. I recently ate here for the first time in a couple of years, and I swear that their food has gotten better. My family and I shared a couple of calzones, a pizza, and a pasta dish, and everything was a hit. They have great daily deals, the best of which is probably their football-sized calzone for $8 on Mondays, which was a big hit with many of my friends. That includes three toppings, and extra ones are just $1. A large percentage of the calzone is just bread though, so I recommend getting a dipping sauce on the side. Just don't try and eat one alone in one sitting."
"Varlamos Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/varlamos-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Susan W.","So this was our second time picking up a pizza. Not sure why I didn't write a glowing review after our first delicious pie. Maybe I was stoned on the garlic goodness??
So it's 4:30 pm & I'm craving a good quality pie. No frozen, take & bake or cheap stuff will do. Having a hard time deciding between Jet City, Santorinis, Olympias & then I see my pic from our last pizza from Varlamos. Winner winner pizza dinner. Call in the order for a half Nina/half Terminator & hubby picks it up. He said it was torture driving home inhaling the aroma without eating a piece. Needed to pop in toaster oven to bring temp back up & crisp crust. Holy Madonna was it ever good!!! You can't go wrong with either the Nina or Terminator. The tzatziki sauce served with Terminator is second only to mine. ;)
Can't wait to go dine in next time and give their salads & pastas a try."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Elyse M.","I came here with a group for dinner. We were seated promptly despite not having a reservation.
I was told the beans in oil and spices was vegan so I ordered that. It was only a couple of bucks and quite good for oily beans. The oil was tasty and whatever spices they put in added a lot of flavor. It was a small plate but enough for me, probably not enough for a full meal if you're really hungry though.
Everyone else enjoyed their meals and wine. The staff were friendly and helpful with food and wine choices."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Robert U.","Magical place
Heard this was so highly rated and so we had to try it out. There are very few Italian restaurants in the US that I enjoy. This little gem is somewhat part of a mall Crossroads Mall BUT once inside, it does not feel anywhere near a mall restaurant, at all.
Good food can be very simple food; you just need to make the flavors come out. The food was fresh and delicious. We loved the atmosphere and the service was just great ... BUT the food was the highlight for all of us. The best carbonara that I've had. The spaghetti was definitely made fresh with its uniquely spongey texture.
What sets it apart the most for me is the food! Delicious food and great service. Since we have been here many times, and I can say the food has always been great! Our waitress was so helpful with the menu and making suggestions. Firenze has extensive Italian wine lists.
The owner Salvatore Lembo of Firenze Ristorante is a very cool guy. Firenze has been in Bellevue at the Crossroads Mall since 1992, serving traditional homemade Italian food based on Salvatore's recipes.
I will definitely eat here again and strongly recommend this Firenze Ristorante Italiano."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Carol M.","We ordered and after hour and half, waitress never came back.
We asked for our appetizers and came and asked for food.they said food was coming
Not true
Everyone who ordered wine was served. Not US. Finally asked for bill. It was on the house. REALLY! I WAS visiting from Pittsburgh and have never beem treated this way at home or Italy. The celebration was sad! Not to topical ITALIAN courtesy."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Chrystal C.","The caesar salad with chicken was good, but the anchovy dressing really sticks with ya. I wasn't prepared for major garlic burps, as I rarely get indigestion. If you're a garlic fan, you'll love it. Authentic Italian, for sure. The owner was there and checked in with us, nice and friendly. Doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall in Crossroads once you're inside. There's a signed pic of Robert Downey Junior on the wall, amongst other not as impressive celebrities. :) If I come back, I'm trying the chicken gorgonzola."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Sarah F.","I last ate here on 9/11/11 after a day of horrifying news about the Twin Towers in NYC. I was at a conference and went to Firenze for dinner, accompanied by at least 10 other people who were from out of town and needed a place to go for dinner. I will never forget how welcoming the owner was. Through his gracious service and good food and wine, he helped remind us that through connections with others we can begin to heal.
So I was looking forward to enjoying another meal almost 8 years later when I was back in town. Once again, my husband and I both enjoyed our meals. I had the Florentine prawns and my husband had the veal piccata along with a Caesar salad and a bottle of reserve Chianti Classico Berardo Castello di Bossi. The wine was excellent and a good value by restaurant standards at $65/bottle, especially since the wine is rated a 98 by one wine expert."

Thanks google!
Let's just say this place IS authentic! (Our waitress was a lovely, smiling, olive-skinned woman who was undoubtedly Sophia Loren's granddaughter!)
The service was wonderful and so was the food. I'm still jealous of my friend's selection: a huge juicy chop! It looked so yummy!
I definitely plan to visit again."

The dining room is a homie feel & welcoming. But, most importantly the QUALITY of the FOOD was EXCELLENT. Prices were very good. This is the type of place that you find very rarely."

"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Paula D.","This was a disappointing experience. Food was below par...Ceaser salad over fish and oily, pasta overcooked and sauce tasted salty, eggplant too mushy in the eggplant parmesan and cheese seemed as if it wasn't fresh. Servce was ok as were prices and the atmosphere is nice but even the bread wasn't good and they charged for it."

I had the salmon with capers and it was good. Service was very good. Ambiance was decent. White linen table cloths. The bread was fair and the drinks were fair. Would come back to give another try. Lasagna looked very good."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Jacques I.","Not too shabby. I visited for a private dinner party that my friend was having, and the service couldn't have been better! There's much to rave about with Firenze's customer service. It was fantastic! The owner even came out to check up on our group of 40. And since there was such a large group of us, I was impressed by how often the servers checked up on everyone, making sure we were all having a good time and received what we needed and ordered.
For group dining, there were three entrees to choose from and we ordered several bottles of white and red wine, which the servers made sure to keep refilling our glasses with instead of us doing it ourselves! For me, I chose the salmon entree, which came with roasted potatoes and green beans, and each item started with a house salad. We also had a few plates of the antipasto platter for all of us to share. Of everything I ate, I actually was surprised by how much I liked the antipasto plate! The prosciutto was sooo good and it went well with the cheese and olives also provided on this platter. All of the charcuterie meats were solid though. My salmon dish was fine. The salmon was slightly overcooked, but still was tasty; yet wish there had been more roasted potatoes. It seemed disproportionate, especially to the green beans. But in total, it wasn't a bad dish.
Overall, I had a fun time at Firenze! Firenze is located at Crossorads Mall, where parking is easy to find. You don't be disappointed with the awesome service while finding traditional Italian dishes offered here."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Jerice A.","This reminded us of being in Tuscany! Authentic Italian service, and the owner was even there greeting folks as they enjoyed their meal.
Hands down, one of the best spaghetti carbonara there is. Spaghetti bolognese was delicious as well. And the wine selection is superb. Everything from Tuscany is fantastic, specifically the Chianti Classico.
The ambiance will take you right back to Italy. Small tables, fresh pasta, aperol spritz's, and hearing Italian spoken by various tables in the background. I will be coming back for some of Bellevue's best Italian food."

Overall it wasn't bad. They screwed up our salads and once they realized that they comped them which was nice. The desert was homemade and pretty good. We might be back."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Brian C.","What a lovely gem, hidden in suburban Bellevue (Crossroads). Lamb chops were cooked perfectly with mushrooms. The swordfish was prepared to perfection as well. I loved the pasta that comes with both, perfect again with olive oil and garlic. Salvatore was such a generous host on Christmas Eve. He was quite entertaining to my daughters. Added bonus: best selection of Brunello di Montalcino in the PNW."
"Firenze Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/firenze-ristorante-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Tracy F.","I had recently heard of Firenze and had been very eager to try it. While in the Crossroads area this afternoon, I decided to stop in for a late lunch shortly after 2:00 PM. I was unaware however, that the establishment closed at 2:00 PM after the lunch rush (they later open at 4:00 PM for dinner).
Even though I was late, Madalina seated me and cheerfully took my order. It had been quite some time since I'd had lasagna and I decided to give it a try. The order was prepared relatively quickly, and when Madalina delivered it to the table, I was pleasantly surprised. The portion was good sized, especially given it was for lunch. The waves of pasta, cheese and red meat sauce were exceptional, so much so, I didn't leave anything on my plate!
Upon presenting my check at the table, Madalina provided me with a couple of valuable coupons which will save us significantly on our next visit.
Please do not hesitate to visit this gem in the Crossroads area. Both the service and the cuisine are outstanding!"

3) clam pizza - 5/5 (LOVE this)

"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Hillary P.","One of my favorite places on Mercer Island! Used to go here all the time for my lunch break. Lunch combo; Pizza with a side salad. Usually I would get the Caesar Salad and Zucca Balsamica. So good! Seasonal cocktail drinks are a must try. Happy Hour is also a great option when is comes to $$
Large groups more than six is pushing it when it comes to getting a table right away and they don't like splitting the bill more than two ways.
Outdoor seating is an option during the warmer months and can get a bit hot depending if your under the umbrella.
I've recently changed jobs, but if I'm ever in the area this is where I would go."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Carrie M.","Love the vibe of this place. I've been to the one in West Seattle and it feels very similar. Try their breakfast pizza with eggs and bacon on it. So good. They have delicious pizza crusts. Also got a side of the hash... Fantastic. After we eat breakfast sat at the bar and watched the end of the football game. It was fun to watch the Brewster make copies. I even showed him the design of an elephant and he tested it on his next customer. Which by the way they have delicious lattes too.
As we were getting ready to leave we saw a dish go by that looked fantastic. We ordered one to go. It was a for Todda I believe and it was so fluffy and had a great feta cheese on top."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Michele S.","This place has the best crust I've ever had. My favorite is at Tutta Bella, and i didn't think they could be beat. The salad was okay, we had beet and Caesar. The meatball Sandwich was meaty. Two large gender neutral bathrooms. Our waiter was really patient with our group, we hadn't seen each other in years and we had a picky eater amongst us I can understand why there was no arugula salad due to the shortage, but why was the clam pizza unavailable? A huge thanks for not pushing out the door when we stayed for hooooours catching up really apprecIated that. I'll be back, the brunch menu looked fun!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Beth s.","Service and atmosphere is good. Had the eggplant parm and it was just okay. I think the pizza is the way to go. Muscles are good too."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Casey B.","Food was okay but the ambiance wasn't great as the restaurant was very noisy with the phone constantly ringing and the bartender calling out to servers to pick up drinks. Be sure to pay particular attention when ordering during happy hour, as they have a creative definition of what does and does not qualify. I also noticed a bunch of black flies hovering around the trashcan behind the bar area, so I'm also not sure how sanitary the place is."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Candace H.","A great weekday brunch/lunch spot! I like how peaceful the area is where this restaurant is located. They have outdoor seating with umbrella shades and since its summer, we went for that!
They have a large variety of options on their breakfast and lunch menu and they also offer a good lunch ""combo"" where you can get a pizza and a side salad of your choice. For those who aren't too into the pizza life, they have plenty of other options like a morning hash or baked egg dishes, or even salads and a variety of appetizers.
I went for the Stromboli - it was basically like a breakfast calzone. When it arrived, I loved the presentation; it was cut in half and you can see all the good goods they packed in this carb pocket. The dough they use to make the stromboli was AMAZING; its soooo soft. Its filled with thin potato slices, tomato sauce, eggs, caramelized onions, cheese, pancetta, I would highly recommend trying this! Its filling and for such a good price too at 10.95!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Huong L.","I wish I can give this place a 4.5 stars or something because it's definitely a hidden gem on Mercer island. I had an appointment nearby so decided to grab dinner here and was not disappointed at all.
Came during happy hour and got the lamb pizza, the clam dish, the calamari and the Beet salad.
Beet salad: really good flavor, the dressing was really light and worked well with every part of the salad
Clam dish: these clams are plump and juicy and was really good.
Calamari in tomato/olive sauce: flavor was good, it also came with their bread which was like a denser version of a pita bread.
Pizza: the lamb was a little too chopped up for my liking but the flavor was all there.
Service was really good. Price during happy hour is very good considering it is in Mercer island. We ordered a little too much and had to take left overs but during happy hour, you can have a fairly filling dinner for under $20."

Waiters are friendly, service tends to be relatively smooth, and the meals are pretty good. Prices are expectedly steep however I have been spoiled by the creativity of Seattle's wonderful restaurants and sometimes crave a bit more from Mioposto. With a few simple steps it could really elevate itself to another level. That being said- pizzas are yummy and salads are a great portion size. Bread is ridiculously pricey for the portion you get but the antipasti board is a stunner!"

She was very helpful in answering all of our questions regarding their impressive menu. We had ordered a variety of pizza and overall had an excellent experience. Ingredients are made in-house and fresh as can be. The food will leave you feeling satisfied and not overwhelmed like any acclaimed fast food chains. Mioposto is on another level of pizzaria. Highly recommend the classic Margherita for starters, all the way to the La Formosa. We paired our dishes with a refreshing Paloma. When we visit Seattle again, we will surely be back."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Hans A.","While in the area, my wife and I decided to go some where to have brunch today. The menu at Mioposto looked very interesting, so we decided to try it. The appearance of the store front looked a little trendy which is ok. The interior is very trendy/Italian rustic. The firewood and lighted MIO letters were a great touch to the wine storage. The menu selection is very intriguing.
We first ordered tea and an americano (my only suggested change).
Then I ordered the Fratatta Pancione w/o mushrooms and my wife ordered the Panenata.
My wife said her Panenata was unbelievable and loved every bite.
My Fratatta Pancione was perfect. It comes with arugula and a little arugula with every bite gives it a little earth spice.
Our server Megan was first class. Very attention oriented and was so friendly. Knew the menu like she wrote it her self. She should be running the front of house she was so good.
My only suggestion, this is an Italian restaurant, serving beautiful Italian. Up the coffee experience. Get a local small coffee roaster to make a private roasted dark Italian blend coffee and offer real Italian coffee. Suggestion: Semi sweet Mochas?
Love this place and most certainly will be back again.
BTW: we didn't get to try it, however the a person sitting next to us had the Eggs and Bacon breakfast Pizza. It looked EPIC!!!!!"

The staff were awesome. We had a table outside in the shade of sunbrellas. It was a beautiful PNW June day.
We shared the Ceci, calamari, and lunch with balsamic pizza and arugula salad. Every dish was spectacular. The Ceci was particularly fabulous, as was the puttanesca that came with the calimari. The bread was some of the best that I've had. I used to make Italian bread with a Sicilian family, and I loved your crust and the fluffy but substantially chewy interior.
My only suggestions are: 1) please share that Ceci recipe with me!!; and 2) I would lightly bread and fry the calamari and serve it with the puttanesca as a sauce/dip, along with an aioli.
Thank you for a memorable and sweet Sunday lunch."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Bryan M.","We hadn't stopped on the island to eat in a very long time (if ever since we've lived here) so we chose Mioposto for a late lunch date.
We were welcomed upon entering and sat down to explore the menu.
My guy and I chose the lunch special: 8"" fired pizza and small salad. I ordered the 'Zucca Balsamica' with a side beet salad; the pizza was fired perfectly! Olive oil base, roasted butternut squash, pancetta, mozzarella, caramelised onions, garlic, rosemary, chèvre, red pepper, and topped with a balsamic reduction. The small salad of mixed greens were topped with heaping portions of chèvre and beets.
My guy ordered the 'Quattro Fromaggi' and a small caesar salad. His fired pizza had a red sauce base, mozzarella, fontina, gorgonzola, and grana with a lemon zest finish.
We swapped a slice with one another and really enjoyed our own pizzas as well as the other's.
Mioposto is a great place and I recommend stopping in for some tasty Italian grub!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Bianca S.","Mercer Island has grown up since I lived there. Mioposto has more delicious breakfasts on the menu than we could choose. I ended up choosing the Morning Hash with crispy pancetta contrasting arugula and topped with two eggs. My friend has The Baker, eggs with sausage in a tomato sauce served with a round of fresh bread. I can't fault either.
The coffee was good. I've had better but I've had many many worse lattes. I'd definitely go back."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Serena L.","One of my favorite spot to grab lunch; and my go to combo is Pepperoni Puntura + Arugula Salad. The pizza comes out with a thin and crispy crust. Pepperoni Puntura has tomatoes, mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, shaved grana, and chili flakes, topped with a drizzle of floral honey. It was so good! The drizzle of honey offset the spiciness of the chili flakes."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-mercer-island-3?osq=Italian+Food","Kristen L.","Yum! This is one of my favorite spots on the island. I had gone to the location in Seattle previously and really liked thenpizza so I was excited when I found out that Mioposto had a location in the island too. The butternut squash pizza is my favorite. Crust is thin, flavorful and the combo of butternut squash and prosciutto is the perfect balance of salty and sweet.
The small downside is that one pizza isn't quite enough food for 2 people. So you should probably get an appetizer too. I believe they also charge for bread which is kind of a bummer. Nevertheless, these things aren't big detractors at all. This is still my go-to place for dinner on the island."

Limoncello is somewhere that you can sit down and have a hearty pasta dinner or stop in for a breakfast sandwich. The pastries here are delicious, well presented, baked on-site, and much appreciated after a satisfying meal or along side flavorful espresso.
The photo features the Orange Tiramisu -
This was my first time having this version of this dessert, but was immediately impressed by the depth of the flavor. From the orange glaze on top, to the orange flavor imparted in the tiramisu itself, this is a wonderful palette cleanser."
"Limoncello Belltown","https://www.yelp.com/biz/limoncello-belltown-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carrie S.","Cutest little place that took over an old Starbucks. Decent pasta lunch specials ($1 when you need a carby treat. Didn't try the amazing looking pastries but would definitely come back for a few. The case they were in was a little dirty but just with crumbs I suspect from pulling things in and out. I ordered lasagna to go and it took quite a while. Maybe order ahead of time next time I walk down!
The lasagna was tasty and fresh but a little cream sauce heavy. Would have liked to see a little menu that gave ingredients so I could have made a more educated decision. Will definitely try other dishes and ask more questions!"
"Limoncello Belltown","https://www.yelp.com/biz/limoncello-belltown-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley K.","I'm so thrilled that Limoncello has touched down in Belltown. The building it's in was in dire need of a cute occupant, and it certainly is just that. The inside is so quaint and picturesque. I first noticed this place just by passing by on the sidewalk, and otherwise wouldn't have known about it at all. Some sweet smells wafted from the doors, and I thought oh, I'll have to try this. I'd assumed it was just a bakery, but boy was I wrong! They've got it all...
My date and I shared a chocolate tart, a pressed salami sandwich that came with an arugula salad, and an order of eggplant parm. We dove into the chocolate tart first while we waited on the other items, which took a little while with only two folks staffed, from the looks of it. The sandwich was juicy and full of really delicious meat, but the salad was really amazing. The cheese they topped it with and the Balsamic were just perfect. The eggplant parm came out piping hot and full of fresh oregano. What a comforting dish! So much cheese!
I honestly can't wait to take dates here, cozy up with a coffee and pastry in a booth, and have a glass of wine at their bar. The varied seating options really leave it open to anything. Hell, they even had sports on a big TV if that's your thing.
So why the -1 star? Growing pains, which maybe isn't fair, but having just started out, they clearly haven't gotten it all figured out yet. 1) put your prices up, please 2) make the menus easier to understand 3) the space is varied and cute, but it left some disorganization in terms of where the line started/orders were taken, and the wine bar on the side seemed totally forgotten... I also winced as the woman behind the pastry counter accidentally knocked a croissant right into a full cake, damaging the beautifully frosted top. Like I said, growing pains!"

He offers some gluten free options as well which is a huge plus for me. This gem is a must try!!! We are SO happy Limoncello opened and that it is close to where we live!!"
"Limoncello Belltown","https://www.yelp.com/biz/limoncello-belltown-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tommy S.","I ordered ahead of time on Ritual and entered to pick up my cappuccino.
Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by an employee behind the counter (or perhaps it was the owner). My cappuccino was freshly made and tasted absolutely delicious.
The interior design was well thought out, cozy, and very inviting. The wifi connection is stable and fast enough for most people.
They also have an assortment of food that I would love to try another day.
Overall, I highly recommend this business: the service is excellent, and the quality of the food/drinks is top notch. Who wouldn't want to support such a business?"
"Limoncello Belltown","https://www.yelp.com/biz/limoncello-belltown-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Emma N.","This cafe/restaurant opened up in my neighborhood recently, and I've been dying to try it! Today I finally did, and will definitely be back.
The interior is nice- seating is a bit limited, but the place itself is spacious. It has high ceilings, a glass case where you can ogle the pastries, a bar top where you can sit and watch the chef/patissier doing his craft, and some booths along the wall for dining.
First of all, the service. I personally witnessed the owner & chef greeting & good-byeing every customer. He even ran to open the door for a lady who had her hands full. All while graciously answering every question I asked him. When I asked him about the pastas, he explained every pasta with detail. Interestingly enough, my boyfriend and I had stopped by a week before and even though we didn't dine at that time, he remembered me.
I settled on a manicotti, and it was delicious!!! The pasta tubes were stuffed with roasted chicken, ricotta cheese, spinach, and bechamel sauce. They were nestled in tomato sauce, and were topped with 2 tomatoes. I devoured it, and will definitely be back to try the other dishes... especially one of the tarts that I was eyeing!!!
The only thing is that I didn't see any glasses for water, but hopefully they will have some glasses and a pitcher soon. :)"

The speciality espresso drink I had was delicious (Carmel, vanilla orange). The owner was a kind, attentive, artisan who clearly appreciates beauty. I felt like I was transported to Italy. This is not your typical coffee shop. There are handmade gnocchis being rolled behind the counter, beautiful croissants and scones, and tarts bursting with colorful sugared fruits on display--Everything Is made from scratch. The decor is stunning. It's an amazing fusion of a vintage and modern American and Italian decor--with 4 huge exquisite Art Deco chandeliers, modern orange Booths that are perfect for studying or communing with friends, a wine bar and counter that resemble a quaint Italian grocery. The space is huge and open. There were so many people inside that there could almost be more seating in the middle to accommodate more people--this is def a space that people will want to stay for a while in. It makes you want to put down your phone and enjoy the people around you. I will be back for sure"

I received a Yelp alert to new and goodly places, and this one has been on my radar instantly. Belltown, you are so, so lucky! Anyway the story is I shot down here by a rocket and missed my exit on the new 99. tunnel, however that was a gas. Ended up a Lams Seafood and while they have beautiful fruit, the smell in the back is atrocious, really wakes you up at 9AM on a Sunday. I turned the ship around and found a parking place near Lemoncielly, that you can pay for in front of a fire hydrant. Sounds like a trap, eh? So I hopped into Limoncello and the owner is ever so nice and very different from our Italian stereotypes, because his is Italian Swiss which makes him so much more interesting. Because of the fire hydrant part of the equation, I didn't have the chance to speak a little Italian and find the owners name, however I will next time. I spent almost $100 and bought a bunch of pastries and a giant pastry apple cake like thing. He said it would be a hit on Thanksgiving, and now is your chance to do the right thing and get one yourself. Now everything is extremely well made, flavors are strong and on target. Sugar is very low which I dearly appreciate, just sweet enough, however, yet no overpowering cloud of sugar smell when you walk in. The apple pastries were over the top and I had to stop eating it just to write this review. You have to realize the berries and apples etc, are all pretty costly to cook down and put in a pastry, so these are really a labor of love. Love you Limonciello, see you soon! I think I will bring a paint bucket to put over that fire hydrant next time :)"

Try to turkey and cheese croissant or the chocolate shortbread. Their specialty lattes are something to check out, too."

It was amazing! She had the Lavender caramel latte and I had and orange caramel latte. Both were so very good. Natural bold flavors with no extra sugars added when made. I added a little honey to mine which really complimented the drink.
This place is 6 weeks new and is a hidden gem for a great cup of craft coffee.
My girlfriend got a chocolate croissant that was to die for.
As this place is newer it's only a matter of time until it becomes super popular. I think this is an amazing alternative to the overly sugared drinks at Starbucks.
This Italian cafe has a real industrial look about it and we really enjoyed our experience.
I look forward to seeing this place take off!"

Cute little space in the heart of Columbia City. They have a great lunch and happy hour, I'd recommend coming during those times. Server was great. They were out of a couple of items, but it was right after the holiday so I can't complain too much.
FOODWe went with the Salerno, which is a great light salad for the table. The basil is super fresh and the buffalo mozzarella is a familiar but new taste/consistency for the dish. No complaints with this one.
For pies, we went with the Prosciutto e Funghi, which was a great red sauce pizza. They don't skimp out on the prosciutto! This one was really good too, it was everything I'd expect from a red sauce prosciutto pizza. Salty, and a great crust.
The second pie was the Roberto. This used the buffalo mozzarella again, and also a pistachio puree for the sauce. I've never really had a pizza like this, but I loved this one. It wasn't too heavy, and the ingredients all just seemed to work well together.
OVERALLGreat happy hour and lunch. No complaints here."

For apps, we ordered the marinated beets which is on the HH menu. The dish consists of roasted beets, red onion, pistachio, goat cheese, and red wine vinaigrette. It is such a light and refreshing dish that I recommend ordering before pizza. We also ordered the clam dish off the HH menu which I highly recommend. The tomato sauce is super flavorful and taste so good with toasted bread. I love how the clams tasted fresh and each shell had a clam inside.
For pizzas, we ordered the Leornardo (tomato sauce, italian sausage, roasted red pepper, calabrian chile, roasted onion, fresh mozzarella, provola and oregano) and Capricciosa (tomato sauce, ham, artichoke, mushroom, kalamata olive, fresh mozzarella, and basil). The pizza are thin crust pizza baked in a wood-fire oven. My favorite is the Leornardo between the two. It is more flavorful and you can't go wrong with ingredients.
Service was good as well. Overall, I would definitely return if you are craving for pizza or cute date/family spot."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Columbia City","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-columbia-city-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","David H.","Solid Italian restaurant in Columbia City. You'll like this place more if you're into pizzas and vegan options as that makes up most of their menu. They do have pasta and meat options, but the selection is pretty scarce. I was only interested by 1 pasta option and none of the pizzas, but I liked what I ordered enough to have a good meal.
I had the bruschetta, neopolitan meatballs, and the gnocchi with braised beef. If you asked me to choose anything else on the menu I'd have a hard time doing so. The food I did order was great though. The bruschetta and meatballs was an absolutely perfect combo. The potato gnocchi was very tasty, although a bit saltier than it should have been.
The service here was fast and attentive. Came a few minutes past happy hour but they still gave us happy hour prices. It was a pretty busy place on a friday evening though so plan accordingly.
Overall, if you're in the area and want Italian food, this is a good choice. But if you're like me and want pasta but not pizza, look elsewhere. Definitely wish there were more pasta options."

i came here to catch up with some high school friends & had always seen this restaurant but never visited! anyways, the ambience was nice & a bit nicer than casual. this is a cute italian restaurant with a great wine list, they do the fire wood pizza so you are greeted with a huge wood stove oven in the background when you walk in.
there was three of us, so we split two pizzas. we got the leonardo & the bianca. i also ordered a glass of wine, i got the etna rossa which was the highlight of my night.
here's the thing about the pizza, it was not terrible at ALL! it just didn't excite me, it was decent but something about it was just not satisfying. maybe the style of pizza is too fancy for me but yeah, in my personal opinion my experience was missing something.
for dessert: the tiramisu was delicious though! was happy that we topped off our visit with this

One night, we were finally able to try it out together! I can't quite remember exactly which pizza this was but it was good. The pizza stood out, as it was loaded, flavorful and had a great texture to its crust, not too thick and not too thin. The Napoli salad was delicious and had lots of toppings. I think the spaghetti alle vongoli was nicely made; however, I feel like there could have been something more to it. Perhaps more clam and sauce. The burrata with peppernata was a bit too oily but tasty nonetheless. Ordering to go via phone was timely and order was accurate. Def stop in for the pizza and salad."

This place was once not very popular (as their happy hour was not well known). The pizza and salad are very good, handmade, and mouthwatering. Though even on Sunday's this place is packed to the beams, which makes the service slow and sometimes frustrating, however one has to keep in mind that you are getting your money's worth. This place is a nice treat, offering a good location and ambience with light decor as well as ample artificial and natural light, with colors that help make the food pop. Although one gripe is in a sunny day, which Seattle rarely gets in the winter months, make sure to avoid the windows or else you'll be blinded by the bright sunlight even with the shades drawn.

"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Columbia City","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-columbia-city-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Erin J.","We're loyal Tutta Bella customers but this last visit was nothing short of disastrous. We came in around 5:15PM when it wasn't terribly busy. We had to wait forever just to get menus. Once we placed orders for our drinks and an appetizer (our go-to ciabatta and stracciatella), it was an absurdly long wait to get our food and drinks. Given that it wasn't that crowded when we placed our orders, and neither our drinks nor appetizer should have taken more than a minute to prep, this was inexcusable.
When we finally received our drinks and appetizer, we tried placing our order to go. We attempted to order their seasonal gnocchi and their lasagne, and were informed the lasagne was already sold out for the evening. The server told us that they only made eight lasagnes per night, which is ridiculous to have a menu item that sells out THAT early prior to closing. We modified our order and, again, waited and waited.
While we waited for our to-go order, we asked for a second round of drinks. Our server seemingly forgot, and ten minutes later, we had to remind her about our drinks. Several minutes later we were brought our drinks, but our food was nowhere in sight. Finally, about an hour and a half after we arrived, we finally got our food.
Stupidly, I didn't check the order before leaving. When I got home, I opened the box to find the most pitiful portion of gnocchi. It looked like a child's portion of pasta. Seriously, for $18+, I'd expect a normal sized portion of pasta. And, it was just average at best. Three tiny pieces of beef, and the gnocchi was on the overcooked, mushy side.
What gives, Tutta Bella? You used to be so good. This has me questioning whether I'll be back, particularly to this location."

Pizzas are only $10, which is a great deal. I'm not usual a big pizza fan, but I can get on board with Tutta Bella because their pizzas are like what you find in Europe. If you're hungry, or with a hungry person, you should each get your own. If you just want a snack, you're fine to share. I love the white pizza. My husband was skeptical of it because he loves tomato sauce but once he tried some he basically ate it all. They also have gelato, which I am very interested in trying, I just haven't gotten around to it yet The service is great and it's on the charming Columbia City main strip.

The pizza is always very consistent. When I first tried Tutta Bella I was surprised that there was no pepperoni on the menu. But then I got a real education Nepolitan pizza and the making to those standards.
Very thin crust, perfectly chewy but not all doughy.
Not too heavy on the sauce but just the right amount, and just a hint of sweetness.
They have ready made choices or build your own. I like prosciutto and arugula with red sauce.
It takes less than 5 minutes for pizzas to cook in that super high heat. You don't have to wait very long to get a very delicious and filling pizza.
They have some delicious sides, salads, and a few other items such as gelato. All are good.
This place will make me come off of my low carb lifestyle if I were close enough to go there as I used to be up until a few years ago.
For those of you who love pizza, and can consume carbs, I highly recommend that you give to to Bella a chance. I would love to hear your comparison to other pizza places, especially any others certified Neopolitan."

The food does not evoke any strong feelings but it's easy if you have kids or just want to relax. Good compromise between la Medusa and pagliacci.

Freaking noisy as hell. Would not bring a date here or have a business meal here. The concrete floor and walls with the people packed in really made it hard to hear. The waitress wouldn't raise her voice so I had to ask my friend to repeat everything she said.
I had the meatball and ricotta pizza which had the perfect balance of cheese and meat. The crust was just all right. It was on the thinner side; I like a doughier/thicker crust on my pizza. I also had the chocolate panacotta which was delicious!
Friends had the bianca pizza and mediterranean pizza. They said they were great. One friend got their espresso served with a chocolate gelato, and she reported it was a divine combo and a jolt of caffeine.

Safe to say the worst pizza I've had in a while. I had a chance to watch the kitchen crew make a few pizzas while I waited and there wasn't any pride in producing a quality product.

"Grappa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grappa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nita L.","Perfect date spot with beautiful lights and overmelted candles that compliment the dim ambience well.
Food here is delicious, albeit a tad bit expensive. Portion sizes are small, but it will leave you licking your fingers till the very last bite.
Cuisine here is a mix of Mediterranean and Italian food."
"Grappa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grappa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mark T.","Came by Grappa in the early afternoon for a group event. It was totally excellent! First off, our group was really huge - spanning at least 3 tables. The server accurately ran many separate tabs accurately and without complaint. In general the service was spot on.
The event went on for quite a while with people coming and going so I actually ordered food two different times. My first food came from the lunch menu - I had the Meatballs w. marinara, mozzarella and parmesan and the soup: Charred Cauliflower Soup w. bacon, almonds & truffle oil. I would have provided a picture of the meatballs, but I ate them before thinking of taking a photo - OOPS. Both dishes were great and I would gladly order them again. Nice presentation on both, too!
Then maybe an hour later I went for the chicken Caesar and the saganaki - fried sheep cheese for the uninitiated, like me. I'll be honest I ordered it because a) it's fried, b) it's cheese, and c) the phrase ""fried sheep's cheese"" is amusing to me. Again, both these dishes were excellent.
My only slight ding (not enough to take a star off though) is that you can't order from the happy hour menu in the 'dining area', but you can't bring kids into the bar. It's a Catch-22.
Prices were a good value, the standard Queen Anne parking caveats apply, though I was able to get a spot right outside. Kudos to our server Chynna too."

The Brussels sprouts were a major disappoint as they were raw and nearly inedible. Hubby had seafood Risotto, and it was delish but very rich. Stepson has the Paella, and he said it was very good. Nice server."
"Grappa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grappa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ajay S.","Hokay. So. Queen Anne's a nice place in general. It's hard not to have a good meal here. But Grappa - solid, solid establishment.
The semi melted Saganaki cheese was entertaining. We ordered the Greek Lemon Chicken - meat was cooked perfectly, and the jus was.. jus-t right. Ok I'll stop that. Sorry. Lamb chops - chunky little buggers. Quite filling.
And Gem, the restaurant manager (also makes the Kizuki/Kukai ramen joints across WA) brought us a flourless chocolate cake for dessert that stole the show. If I ever met a chocolate cake that could double as construction material, it was this. And it meant that in a very good way. Dense, firm, but delicious chocolate - untainted by the frivolity of flour. Excellent dessert. Sorry - got carried away again.
Point is - great food, good ambience, great service. Go to here."
"Grappa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grappa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Savannah S.","Grappa is one of my absolute favorite places to eat in Queen Anne. It is reliable, quaint, quality food with a bit of creativity and great service. I come for happy hour a lot (4-6pm) to get some apps and their house wine - only $6!
Big fan of their soups - they rotate often and are amazing!! The soups in the fall are the best.
The truffle burrata, clams, focaccia bread, gnocchi, scallops pasta are some of my favorites!
This last visit I had the lamb pappardelle and my boyfriend had the pesto gnocchi! Both were great, I preferred the gnocchi, but the pappardelle was still great.

"Grappa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grappa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jaclyn F.","The food at Grappa is ok. I think for this price you can get a lot better food, but there wasn't anything particularly bad about Grappa. It was just ok. We ordered to Saganaki to share and I got the Braised Lamb Pappardelle as my main. The Saganaki was good but it's also cheese which in my opinion is almost always good. The Pappardelle lacked flavor - particularly in the form of a sauce - but it was ok. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of lamb in it. Overall I would not go out of my way to come back, but I would not object if someone I was getting food with really really really wanted to go here."

Service - wow. Hats off to the servers here. Our waiter was super friendly, engaging, and just totally on it. Good teamwork too. Other servers stopped by to refill water, and engaged in conversation as well. Fun dinner. 5 star experience.
Food - amazing.
Cioppino was delicious! So much flavor, generous amounts of seafood, and perfect consistency in texture. Topped with two slices of bread. Good to share too.
Zucchini Linguine - flavorful, yummy, and hopefully healthy too. I liked it. We shared the two dishes and they went well together.
Bathroom is clean meaning the kitchen is clean too!
Parking - we parked on a residential street half a block from the restaurant on Sat 615pm. Pretty easy to find parking.

"Grappa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grappa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeremy S.","Grappa has always been a consistently good choice for my partner and I when we feel like going out for dinner. We just went again last night (Saturday at 7pm) and were able to get a table almost immediately. You can also book on Open Table if you want to make reservations on your phone.
The decor is a dark restaurant with a lot of candles with wax dripping down them. There's a really nice looking stocked bar and it's a cozy kind of feeling. Also, on Valentine's Day they have had a live musician playing music, which was really nice.
The food is consistently great here. Some of my favorites are the grilled octopus, Saganaki (a kind of grilled cheese with pita on the side), seafood (lobster) risotto, and the lamb gnocchi. Those are definitely my favorite items. There were 4 of us there last night and we just ended up sharing everything which was great! Just a note: The menu can change with seasons, so you might want to check what they have online before going.
Grappa's signature drinks are different than ones I've had at other restaurants. I was surprised that they had a Johnny Walker Black cocktail which was very good (not too sweet). They also have a tasting flight of the different Grappas they have, which is good if those who want to try to drink.
The service has always been consistently great. The waitress made great suggestions on what to order. She also consistently came by to check on us and refill our drinks.
Overall, this is a great place for dinner if you're on a date, with friends, and/or you want somewhere to just relax, drink and converse. The ambiance is very comfortable, dark, and chill. We will definitely be returning to this place."

Great food, amazing selection of wine, and good service - what more could you ask for? We started the meal with the saganaki - yum! prepared perfectly and so delicious! My friend hadn't experienced the joy of saganaki before so it was a great experience for her. Next we shared the black truffle burrata - unique and delicately paired! For dinner I had the winter pasta as I cannot turn down pappardelle if it is offered. They did not disappoint. My friend had the gnocchi (of which I sampled and loved!) and did not leave a single thing on the plate when the server took it away. I am already looking forward to my next visit here - great location with easy parking the north end of upper Queen Anne."

I thought it was too salty and again never had this before so not sure if it suppose to be this salty or not. Besides the gnocchi was too salty, the pasta was good. Many times my head is bigger than my stomach and so to order X Large Combo pizza for (2) is way too much.

A particular compliment goes to their lasagna: it is a family recipe, and they have spices in there that so beautifully go together, you will truly feel like you are just happy and warm all over!

People actually came here 30 mins before to wait until it opens!
Highly recommend the porchetta sandwich. It was very delicious and juicy. I couldn't finish it all so you may want to share. There are seats inside - you may share with people so heads up."

Their sandwiches are made with the fresh bread and the meats freshly sliced/made in house. Of course the porchetta is delicious, but so is the meatball, and so is the pasta, and so is the salami. How I manage to choose, I don't even know! The prices run about $10-13ish and it is SO worth it.
The pricing for their sliced salami is a little cheaper here than at other stores. But the game changer is the amazing deal on their guanciale ($15/lb). I use that on every pasta sauce I make and the flavor is out of this world!!!"

We both loved the porchetta sandwich. The meat was really flavorful, tender and juicy and the bread was soft and really good with it. The meatball one is good as well but the bread was much harder so a little difficult to eat but still really good flavor. Definitely worth it to come check out! Highly recommend the porchetta and try some of their other sandwiches as well! Will be back!"

I got the October special that came with meats, grilled onions (extra?), cheese, and grilled apples which was such a unique touch. It cost approximately $14.
My friend got the porchetta which is their recommended hot sandwich. Both were delicious. The meat in the porchetta was nicely ground and seasoned. My sandwich meat was a bit on the salty side but the apple was an amazing touch.
Things to note: fast service, bus your own tables. Water available, clean shared bathrooms with the building, they have a code. I'd definitely go back, but would likely want to share with a friend again, one full sandwich of the same taste is a bit much for me. I didn't feel like I had enough grilled onions."
"Salumi Artisan Cured Meats","https://www.yelp.com/biz/salumi-artisan-cured-meats-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Young N.","Does a restaurant with 1.3K reviews and an average rating of 4.5 really need another review? No. Nonetheless I'm writing this because this place was just THAT good.
I ordered the Porchetta sandwich. When I initially ordered and the bill came out to $12, I thought ""that's a lot just for a sandwich."" But like what other reviewers have said, the sandwich is just massive. Pictures don't really capture its size well. In terms of portions, it felt equivalent to eating a chipotle burrito bowl or 2/3lb patty burger. I was stuffed, and I'm a big eater.
Quantity, check.
Quality? Double check!
My first bite really surprised me. Not just because how delicious it was but how hot (temperature-wise) the meat was. It was emitting steam as I ate it. Much better than toasted or reheated meat at most places. The pork is freshly braised and it makes a different not just with its temperature but also the texture. It's so tender and juicy. And again, there's just so much of it!
To name a few other standout parts of the sandwich.
- The bread is nice and airy. A bit of a crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.
- The garlic/oil spread on the sandwich is just so well done. Very strong garlicy flavor without overwhelming the other ingredients.
If I had to nitpick at all, I'd say the vegetables were just okay. Especially the onions which had great carmelized flavor but texture-wise was pretty mushy. This is why I'd give a slight edge to Un Bien as Seattle's best sandwich
That said, I absolutely will be back here and look forward to trying the rest of their menu."

Ordered the porchetta sandwich and it was humongous! Like I was able to eat 1/8 of it and was satisfied. It is a pretty simple sandwich. Meat and bread. However, the meat is juicy, tender and really good. The bread they use works really well as it was able to absorb the juice from the meat. For $12, it's a really good deal!!!
The only thing for me was that it was kind of bland. If it just had some salt, it would have been super delicious."

After a year of knowing of this place's existence yet being unable to find a good reason to be in Pioneer Square on a weekday, I was finally able to sneak over now that they're open on Saturdays--and I was not disappointed!
Since I was with a few other friends, we ordered the meat, cheese, and olive platter (yum), the seasonal sandwich (potentially the best sandwich in Seattle), and a side of porchetta (can't miss). Everything was amazing. Even the Olive and Mole salumis, which, I'll admit, I had my doubts.
Next time I'll bring more people and go later in the day so that we can get our wine on--but if you're a fan of cured meats, porchetta, and, well, bring happy, then this is an excellent place to try. Highly recommend if you go with the right group.

I pretty much come here every week for lunch because it's THAT good. They make the best sandwiches in Seattle. There, I said it. It's a bit pricey but you're getting a high quality, large portioned sandwich pretty much every time you come here. Their meats are really good, they source delicious bread from Macrina bakery, and their cheeses are fresh. The staff is super nice. Ever since they moved to the new location, service has gotten better in terms of shorter lines.
Here's my tier list of sandwiches after coming here for consistently for 2 years:
Top tier:
Oxtail sandwich with mozzarella (daily special)
Meatball sandwich with mozzarella
Lamb sandwich with fontina. Ask for Giuseppe bread.
Mid tier:
Finnochiona with mozzarella
Mole with mozzarella
Sausage with peppers (fontina optional)
Hot suppresata with fontina or mozzarella
Low tier:
Porchetta (call me a hater, but it's too salty for me. If anyone has the courage to have it with mozzarella, please let me know how it is)
Grilled cotto (daily special)

If you're not craving the food coma, you should probably just split one of those sandwiches.
Came here an hour before closing so I was able to avoid the long lines. Luckily, the person at the register was extremely nice and helpful and explained how they cure all meats in house and just about everything is delicious. Apparently the porchetta sandwich is the most popular sandwich and I purchased a sampler of 4 cured meats on the side to try because of the namesake...nothing disappointed at all.
Long story short, you get massive amounts of meat in your sandwich and you don't need to worry about being hungry afterwards. Worth a stop if you're in the Pioneer Square area!"

They specialize in their meats like salami. They have a variety of sandwiches and daily specials. It is a bit pricey but worth due to the quality of ingredients they use.
They have plenty of seating indoor and also outdoors. I recently ordered their Salumi salami. I had ordered it to go and warmed. The cashier told me it would take a few minutes longer since I asked for it warm which I was completely ok with. I am a very patient person and saw that everyone was getting their order before me. About 15 minutes passed and I was still waiting for my order.
People went and came and my order did not. Then one of the staff making the food asked me if I was waiting for and order and I told him yes. He apologized for the delay and said it was unacceptable. He immediately told me he would give me a refund for my order. I was not upset at all as I know that everyone makes mistake especially when you are really busy. I love the fact that they immediately offered a refund as most other places would just make you a new order.

I ordered one ala carte meatball, one porchetta, and one small daily special soup. They didn't write it on the board but they do offer two sizes for the soup. All together it cost me $9.38, tips not included.
All food was pretty good, but honestly I was not that impressed. My coworkers heard many good things so we were all hyper-excited to come here all the way from SLU for lunch. Given the price it was definitely great food, but it was certainly not that special. If I didn't have such high expectations, I would probably appreciate the food more.

My coworker had the spaghetti pasta and tomato soup. She stated that it was fresh and she really enjoyed it. They had a good selection of San Pellegrino sodas as well to choose from.
I definitely recommend this shop for some great salami, sandwiches, and soups."

The bread is really fresh and fluffy, I was hoping there would be more variety in the toppings of the sandwiches.
We got here right during closing and ordered a half a sandwich with the traditional salami, and the other half with a mole salami. The bread literally melts in your mouth, I'm obsessed with bread and loved their selection!
But the salami, that's the star of the show. It's so buttery and tears so easily,, there's an incredible amount of flavor with any type that you choose. The sauces they use really complement the salami and additional toppings, I got the garlic aioli sauce."

I was told I should order the Porchetta Sandwich, and so that's what I ordered. For $12.50 it sure seemed like a lot to drop on one sandwich, but believe me, it was worth it!
The sandwich was massive! Like it was a good size portion for two people to split! So, in that sense, it was a solid price if you split it up. The bread was really good and fresh. The pork was flavorful and juicy.
I will say that I was expecting the crisp, crackling skin on the outside of typical Porchetta, so I was a tad disappointed. But that was just a small issue, I will definitely be back here if I'm ever in the area"

I ate my brother's leftover sandwich. I had the Porchetta sandwich and mine was a day old and had it in the fridge until it was my lunch time. I popped in the sandwich in the microwave for 2:30 and the bread was soft for me to eat. I was really impressed with the meat because it was still moist and it wasn't high in sodium (at least it didnt taste like that). The sandwich looks really plain, but it is still flavorful with herbs and loved the pickled jalapenos as it was a good touch. I'm giving 4 stars because I haven't actually gone there, but I would love to go there myself and try them fresh."

Today I visited the new location and this is not even close to what the meatball once was. Different sauce, different meat, different texture, different spices. It crumbles now like an ordinary and hopeless meatball.
The recipe was either not shared with the new owners or they decided it was too expensive to make it properly. This is the biggest food crime of the century.
These are not Leonetta's meatballs they are a travesty."

Me and my friend were trying someone new! Also didn't know it was in a hotel! All facts! Free parking in their Ballard hotel parking lot (in the back).
I wanted a white pasta, they had it and I got it! Delicious thin egg noodles, great flavor, enough to make me full! It was on the weekend/evening menu, so it might not be there again! Everything I wanted wasn't there! No more artichoke, the other items were all from previous menus! I would recommend just going and checking it out! I was very pleased with the choices! The bread was huge and perfect for the pasta meal! (My friend didn't share). But I know it was good! The even do fresh cut meats and cheeses, which is nice!
I got this new tequila mezcal banana liqueur drink! It was great. I was a craft cocktail so I was a fan! My friend got the cherry shrub? That was great! I almost got the dessert but I just wanted something different than pudding! Overall happy camper! Drink, pasta, and appetizer for $65 bucks!"
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","William G.","We don't get to Ballard much, but it is always fun to get out and explore all the unique shops and restaurants. Certainly no shortage of dining experiences here! In the end, we decided to try Stoneburner. No reservations, no tables, so we sat at the bar (which is not as romantic, but much more entertaining).
I ordered one of the Fresh Catch specials, Pan Roasted Black Cod with coconut, pumpkin bisque, crispy Brussels Sprouts, chili oil, Espellete and mint. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the flavors just weren't there. I was so disappointed in how bland it was, especially with the great listed ingredients. I guess just not enough of them.
My wife ordered the Pasilla Honey Chicken, with romanesco, marble potatoes and caper vinaigrette. My BIG mistake was tasting her dish - it was amazing, fabulous use of herbs and spices, crispy skin, everything just excellent. She may have gotten short-changed a bit, as I kept going back to her plate for more.
So, 1) call for reservations! 2) dress up a bit, it's a really nice place 3) I hate to say it, but maybe send it back and order something else if it doesn't live up to its hype. We will definitely be back, and will follow our own advice."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Janhavi B.","Overall: 4/5 - If you like wood-fired pizzas, good wine and a date-sy atmosphere, you'd like this place!
Food: 4/5 - My husband is vegetarian and I prefer veggie pizzas too, so we tried the one with mushrooms and loved it. But what I would definitely recommend is the baguette with
Price: 3/5 - On the pricier side for what it's worth. Turns out we weren't too hungry so we shared an appetizer and a pizza but neither were very large.
Ambience: 3.5/5 - I've only ever been here for dinner and it was a candle-lit and datesy vibe, but also has booths and tables for larger groups.
Service: 5/5 - The server was super cheery and helped us pick out what we'd like best given our mood and dietary restrictions. She also suggested a wine what I loved (but unfortunately cannot recollect the name of)."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alyssa F.","Mediterranean leaning New American fare, inspired by Stone Hearth cooking. The spacious interior is decorated with antique furniture and fixtures that create a cozy, timeless ambiance. The menu features artisan pastas, wood fired pizzas, charcuterie plates, and salads, with a focus on seasonal ingredients. Fantastic wine, beer, and cocktail list as well. We came here with a large group of 8 on Memorial Day weekend and were able to be seated right away.
The Fresh Mozzarella pizza was the star of my meal. Thick slices of the creamy cheese melt into the generous layer of intensely flavorful marinara, atop a perfectly crisp crust. Their use of ""really good olive oil"" was apparent. Another favorite was the Snap Peas, which were unexpectedly inventive. The pods are julienned and tossed in a tangy lemon oil, salty pecorino sardo, and toasted almond slivers. Do not skip this exquisitely balanced dish.
The greens in the Little Gem Caesar were bursting with flavor, and I loved the hominy croutons, but the salad as a whole was over salted. My least favorite dish was the caramelized cauliflower Tortellini, which I found to be bland and lacking substance and inspiration. The Roasted Heirloom Carrots were also disappointing, with an overpowering aftertaste of canola oil that was difficult to ignore, despite the delicious cashew crema they were served atop. Regardless of critiques, I highly recommend Stoneburner for a solid meal in Ballard."

We have been to Stoneburner 3 times over the last couple of years for happy hour and have always left happy :) Service is consistently professional, prompt and friendly. We have always been able to get a table for 2 immediately. They have a few tables outside for when it's sunny and warm that I've really enjoyed sitting at.

"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tori Z.","Returned here last night and was not as amazed as the first time. Food was still phenomenal but the service was sub-par. Our waiter was clearly new so I'll cut them a little slack but they were pulling out detailed notes on the charcuterie options and clearly very frazzled and nervous. As always the veggies were top notch (my favorite are the heirloom carrots and charred broccoli) and the pasta and cocktails were delicious."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Justine C.","The good: service and flavor of most of the food itself
The bad: small portion sizes, more meat than vegetarian options, no free bread!
It seems more and more that gone are the days Italian/Mediterranean restaurants offer a complimentary bread basket with butter (as they should) and instead shrink portion sizes to ones suitable to that for a 10 year old. Trendy vibe hipster places like to act all ""people over profits"" but nope, they care about profits just as much as the nearby McDonalds. Sigh.
We ordered a few dishes: the yukon potato gnocchi, roasted heirloom carrots with cashew cream, roasted broccoli with tahini sauce, grilled octopus, fresh mozzarella pizza, and the apple crostada. The gnocchi was a tad bland, and we finished in only 4 bites (!!) Carrots were interesting. The ones that were cooked well had an amazing flavor with the cream, but many were burnt so we sent them back and they were removed from our bill. My friend has dined here before and made the comment that they put less cashew cream this time than in the past. We loved the broccoli, and the octopus was impressive, as it is hard to cook octopus well. The fresh mozzarella pizza had a nice thin crust, but I thought it could have used more a bit more cheese on it. But that's just because I like a lot of cheese on my pizza. We loved the apple crostada."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Austin H.","I really enjoyed the food here. We sat at the kitchen where we were able to watch the chefs make all the food and they cook so much of it in the pizza oven which I love as that adds a nice char to it all. We started with some bread with ricotta and octopus. The octopus was very tender. Then we had the broccoli, cooked in the oven, with lemon tahini and I think it was the best broccoli I've ever had. I would love to go back to try some of their other vegetables. The pizza we got was fennel sausage and we finished with a key lime custard with strawberry sorbet and the plating on the dessert was beautiful. It had a lively atmosphere and the staff did a great job."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle G.","We always wanted to try this place but it was busy when we walked pass by every time. We made a reservation and luckily parked off the street today. After checking in, we got seated within 5-10 minutes. It's old fashioned, lodge deco with modern upscale menu. The staff were friendly and informed us the restaurant week. We ordered Tuna tip, Cesar salad, grilled octopus, Rogatoni, Asparagus pizza, lemon pound cake and chocolate budino. The service was upbeat even though it's busy. The Rogatoni was perfectly al dente and I loved the running eggs on the pizza. Unfortunately, the server forgot our grilled octopus but we were almost full that time. She apologized for the honest mistake. They sold out the lemon pound cake and offered us chocolate molten cake instead. Love this place and will come back again!"
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Linda S.","Came in around 6:30, it was very busy with some tables reserved, but we got a seat all the same. Comfortable interior, nice lighting. Raised serving platform built onto he booth so we had to sit side by side. No matter. Every dish was good or great, although the Caesar salad and the green salad were both to acidic and too salty. Amazing mussels with delicious sauce you just want to eat with a spoon. Tortellini so smooth and creamy you want to eat it for dessert. Friendly and knowledgeable service."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mitchell V.","Love it when places have unexpectedly great veggie dishes. The carrots and cashew cream were fantastic. I loved the pork cheek orecchiette - basically pot roast with pasta - what's not to love? Really enjoyed the octopus as well - that sauce was something else.
Only let down was the meat and cheese boards. Really expensive for what you get but I am beginning to find that all charcuteries in all restaurants are largely rip offs (exceptions to exist)."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phil M.","Definitely make a reservation if you're coming on a Friday or weekend. I came with some friends and ordered a bunch of dishes to share.
We started off with the crab dip, two pastas the rigatoni and the radiatori (braised short rib), a pie: Chanterelle mushroom and Yukon potato and then a white sauce was poured over it and lastly a rack of lamb ribs.
My favorite dishes were the Radiatori which had unique pastas and fat Chun is of short rib that was super tender. The pizza was flavorful but you had to eat it quick or it would get soggy. The lamb ribs were perfect medium cooked.
The only thing I could complain about was some of the service from our waitress. She had recommended the crab dip for the 5 of us, but you can see in the picture it only cam with two slices of bread. She could have asked if we wanted to order more. When we got the dip we were surprised to find out it had two pieces which she said ""would you like to order more bread""? We ended up ordering more but had to wait and our crab dip was cold."

They make their noodles in house and they are the freshest, lightest, most delicious noodles ever! If you like hearty appetizers, they also have a large variety of meats that they slice in house for their charcuterie boards.

I have to say that this place is consistently very good. The menu changes regularly and it's always a little bit quirky and off-beat. Which I love. They have lots of tasty veggie dishes, which I love. The cocktails are interesting, fun & well prepared, which I love. And it is just a bustling & beautiful place to enjoy a meal.
It is a great place to bring out of town guests for a nice meal, fun with a group, but also just a sold neighborhood spot.
I think if you come in thinking you'll have the best meal you've ever eaten in your life, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. It's just regular food, prepared by the hands of mere mortals, after all."
"Stoneburner","https://www.yelp.com/biz/stoneburner-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cesar C.","I spent two days wondering whether I was going to get salmonella after dining at Stoneburner.
We went to Stoneburner on Friday because we had heard great things about it. And for most of the night, the restaurant seemed to live up to its reputation--the vibe was there, with people having fun at a location that had plenty of character; the service was very good with a server who knew her stuff. The menu offered lots of possibilities for vegetarians, non-gluten diners and more.
The first sign that something was amiss was the grilled octopus: the parts that weren't burnt were delicious--however, too much of the mollusk went beyond seared to just burnt, making some parts of it taste like charcoal. We let it go because the tentacles that were done correctly were delectable.
But then, the entrees came. First, the good: the gluten-free orecchiette with lamb that my wife ordered was creamy, cooked to perfection with peas and tender morsels of lamb. While she was eating that, I was digging into my grilled, spiced chicken. After a few bites, I got the feeling that there was something weird about the texture of the protein. I cut a piece and took a look at it in the dim lighting. What I saw gave me the chills, so I had to ask my wife to confirm what I was seeing: RAW CHICKEN. When the server came by a few seconds later to check on our meal, I asked her whether the chicken looked raw. She took one look and, without hesitation, took the plate to the kitchen. She came back a few moments later and said the kitchen was going to redo my dish and asked whether I would like something to eat while my wife finished her pasta. I asked for the burrata with bread, which she served promptly. I wasn't sure about the meal anymore, but I figured I would enjoy what I could.
The server was very apologetic, and I don't blame her one bit for the kitchen's mistake. However, and I might be a bit too sensitive about this, I thought the manager should have come over to apologize for this. After all, this wasn't simply a case of a steak not being done properly or some other transgression--raw chicken is on a different, dangerous level that deserves more than a free bread and burrata appetizer. The restaurant did not charge for the chicken dish, either.
Luckily, I survived the weekend without getting sick, but I spent 48 hours wondering whether the illness would hit me (technically, salmonella can manifest itself up to 72 hours after ingesting raw chicken).
I'm giving Stoneburner two stars because the service was very good, and I could have eaten two servings of the pasta with the lamb. I regret not ordering that dish from the beginning.
At this point, I don't know whether I will go back. Maybe I could, as long as I stick to vegetarian dishes."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Austin H.","I have never been to Chicago but the folks behind Windy City Pie and Breezy Town Pizza easily make the best Chicago style pizza I have ever had. The pizza is delicious, hearty and well priced. It is great to eat with groups or it reheats well the next day if you have leftovers.
The standard my gf and I usually get is the pepperoni paint job. We then add olives and red onions to it so it has some balance to compliment all the tasty and crispy pepperoni. Your toppings are really all personal preference but their pepperoni and Wisconsin brick cheese blend are good places to start.
They also have some really good brunch pizza on weekends and you can order by the slice as well if you don't want leftovers. Definitely a must hit up spot for pizza fans in the area."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Vivian T.","I never thought I enjoyed deep dish pizza til I went here! It's so hidden on beacon hill but it's a major gem and I'm so glad it's close to home! My boyfriend and I got the pepperoni deep dish. It was so saucy, loaded with delicious marinara! It tastes fresh, the ratios of everything were just right, and I crave this pizza often. I dont know the wait time for a single slice of pizza but we ordered a whole one and it took about 45mins, I think its worth the wait. But its literally o much pizza and its so filling I think one slice is what I'm gonna go for when I come in.
As for the customer service, the servers were nice and straight to the point. The environment is much bigger than I ever expected. I was reading the flyers around the place and I think they have entertainment nights of karaoke, live music, and etc. Its very cute.
Would i come here again? yes, I'm already planning when."

"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Isaac H.","Worth it.
BTP is worth a trip from the city. It's worth the mild L on atmosphere, which is a grungy, red-lit, sparsely decorated concert space that's a bar first and a restaurant second. It's worth the price point, ~$30 after tax for a pie for three. It's worth the wait, which can be 30-40 minutes of cook time for an impromptu walk-in.
There's just no better pizza. Nothing that I've tried in Seattle - or New York for that matter - can match the crusted cheese edge, the sourdough crust, and the incontrovertible degree of witchcraft oozing into every bite. We've all heard that the real Windy City's pizza is overrated, so I don't feel the need to look elsewhere.
Tips:
1) If you're dining in (recommended because delivery through Caviar is subject to extra fees), order online in advance! The site allows you to schedule a dine-in so that you minimize the time spent agonizing over other tables getting their pies before yours. Egoists will delight as under-prepared table-neighbors comment, ""how did they get their food first if they just arrived?""
2) Extra cheese. Do it."

I came here on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating. You order by the bar to the right and then you get a number and sit down at any table.
It is a dive bar kind of feel, just very laid back. The pizza took 30-35 mins to make which they warn you when you order. The pepperoni on the pizza was amazing, the kind that curls up and reminds you of childhood. I love the crust on the pizza, because the cheese melts and makes a crunchy texture. I mean who doesn't love cheese and bread?! My boyfriend and I ordered one whole pizza and we could only finish 4/6 of the slices.
Overall, great place to get pizza."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Joel S.","My brother in law loves this place so we took a drive to the neighborhood to see what the commotion was about.
The food is inside a bar in the back near the stage area. That might be a little confusing but once you know, you know!
You can order a giant pizza for $20+ or just by the slice for $5+. The slices change and new flavors are posted in the board to the right of the register.
I tried the poutine pizza and it was alright. I like the idea of gravy and fries in a pizza but the gravy was lacking for me. I tried it, that's all that matters.
As for the pepperoni paint job, I was happy with my slice. I was hoping there'd be a tad more tomato sauce on it though. The crust was crispy and the pepperoni were crispy as well. Definitely a redemption from the poutine!
All in all I think everyone should check this place out at least once."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Tuan N.","Yum! As a fan of all types of pizza from deep dish to foldable NYC pizza this place has carved a special niche. I would say this is a bit of a Detroit style pizza merged with pan pizza to form that nice crust on the outside and a pillow top of dough to hold the tomato and cheese and toppings. The pepperoni, were on point with the right amount of curl and form little cups.
They have a few other options by the slice and even some brunch pizza options. They are connected to a bar/music venue and I bet it can get packed but going on a Saturday morning it was crowded.
I wouldn't expect to find a place like this in Beacon Hill but glad it's there and will be back again."

I've been hearing through the coffee vine that I ought to check out this joint, but kept sleeping on it, though I regret it, because this establishment brings life to Beacon Hill!
I visited on a Sunday afternoon, and upon arrival the energy was very welcoming and engaging. The bartender was super tentative with greeting customers, and the restaurant manager, Brandon was incredible by helping introduce me to the menu. It amazes me how the team works together to create new pizza creations weekly and crafts them together for the menu!
During my visit I tried;
1. Arugula & Beets Salad
2. Reverse Marg Pizza Slice
So the salad literally made my mouth water as I was eating! I loved how fresh the greens were, and the beets were pickled to perfection! To top it off was the the blue or Gorgonzola cheese, which was enough to get me really comfortable before my slice. Yum!
The pizza slice I had was called the ""Reverse Marg"" which came with pesto base, fresh mozzarella, and fresh tomatoes! Yoooo, the pizza was amazing, from the first bite to the last. Those fresh flavors came together so greatly, and I seriously enjoyed the caramelized crust. Also, I couldn't help but compliment how I felt the pesto was single handily made for ME! Lol.
Beyond the delicious food, this place does special events, live music, and even trivia nights! So check it out!

"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Diana C.","Great pan pizza, not deep dish like Chicago deep dish. Crust is crunchy but the dough puffs up too much which detracts from the flavor. Sauce is not super sweet like other pizza places. The flavor profile balance of cheese and sauce could improve. Acidic sweet sauce and bland cheese. Salty pepperoni so it balances the dough well. Cheesy and greasy. Very heavy with ciabatta crust and greasy pepperoni.
Delicious! You'll have to wait about 25 minutes if they aren't too busy so don't come starving. Their Ceasar salad is good and is a decent portion size. We also ordered the popcorn which was pretty good too, but it could have used more cheddar flavor."

It's about a 45 minute trip for me to get a pie from BTP. I haven't had a bad pizza here and I've tried quite a few of their options. They do a Combination of Detroit still crust with a Chicago style topping set up. It's so good!
If you think the price is steep, I promise these pizzas are enormous and there will be leftovers.
They are located in a bar, so it's not really a ""eat in with the family"" environment, but it's a nice little spot with some great street parking. Showing up a little early and having a quick cocktail is a bonus if you have the time.
I really cannot recommend it enough."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Nathan R.","Not your average pizza. Heard about this pizza joint from my buddy Gabriel. More like angel Gabriel now. Deep crust and solid flavor. Best slice I've had in months, maybe years."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Milomom L.","Super high hopes when we discovered this on Yelp today. We've been to Windy City Pie twice and absolutely love it! So, we jumped on the chance to try out BTP tonight for dinner. Like others have said, parking is tricky. Got there when the place was pretty empty, only one customer ahead of me picking up to go. I grabbed my pizza (Pete and Pete) and got the instruction to hold the pizza flat and was on my home...a good 20-30mins. Mid-way, (hubs driving), I started to feel moisture in the upper right corner of the box...and it started feel more and more wet. Weird. When we got home, I opened the box and saw that even though I held said pizza flat as instructed, the toppings all slid forward because the pizza was undone and really wet. Oh, and as the British Baking Show loves to say...soggy (raw) bottom! Not good for pizza, yeah? We tried to remedy by trying to put couple of pieces in Air Fryer--much better. Toppings were spot on and like the original Windy City Pie (thus 3 stars)--yum. Off night? Not sure. Worth the drive? We're thinking about it..."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica M.","Lives up to the hype! Exceeds the hype. I ordered to go and experienced the heaven in my own home. I generally am a thin crust person and after living in NY I can get real picky about dough and sauce... but the photos and the reviews brought me in and I can say my Seattle pizza life has been changed forever.
The Pepperoni pizza. perfectly crisped cups of pepperoni to accent the rest of the pizza's perfection. Somehow the taste of pepperoni permeated the sourdough crust to the bottom of the pie, making every bite savory and delicious. The sauce is perfectly spicy and rich with flavor. the crispy cheese crust is faint-worthy. the cheese sort of pooled to the middle of the pie but I can't say that I missed it in other bites, every bite was literally the best bite. The dough is outstanding. I don't quite understand it but it is noteworthy. And quite filling, but not in a way that makes one irritated like I am full of empty fluff bread. No No, I was full in the most satisfied way.
I ordered a veggie special slice (white sauce, sweet potatoes, fennel) to go as well, but it could not touch the pepperoni so after two bites I saved it for today's breakfast with an egg. I reheated on a cast iron skillet on medium low, and it was delicious as well. Kale caesar was a bit dry, but super fresh and with the lemon, actually balanced out the grease from the pizza well. It would have been cool to throw an anchovy on there, but I get that there are more anchovy haters than lovers. Between Breezy Town for medium dish and Humble Pie for thin crust I can count on these two as monthly standards as long as I live in Beacon Hill."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Janet S.","Not only what is this place dark and divey you have to be the one to place your order or get your own drink at the bar. The deep dish style did not appeal to me, because it was just too greasy, and over done on the edges. Even the pepperoni on top was burnt. Would not go out of my way to frequent this place."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jeffrey W.","One of the best pizza in Seattle, hands down! Im a thin crust guy but this medium deep dish is so bomb. It isn't straight Chicago deep dish so it's not as filling. The crust is what sets it apart from the rest. Dubbed as Detroit style pizza, the crust is crispy burnt cheese. That's not all, it's topped with crispy pepperoni. So each bite is super flavorful, oily, crunchy and cheesy. I usually just sit there and would eat half the pie and contemplate if I want to eat the whole thing.
This place is tucked away in the back of the lockout lounge on Beacon. Order in advance and you can just pick it up. They even deliver. Since I live so close, this was my go to pizza spot."
"Breezy Town Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/breezy-town-pizza-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Bryan K.","Breezy Town Pizza is a sister location to Windy City Pizza. If you've been to Windy City Pizza, you already know what to expect. Deep Dish Heaven.
I came with a friend and split the classic Pepperoni Paint Job pizza. They start with a sourdough crust with a ring of caramelized cheese around the edge. It might look burnt, but it's actually the best part of the pizza. The pizza is topped with Wisconsin brick and mozzarella cheese and two kinds of pepperoni. The little pepperoni slices curl up into perfect crispy cups of meat goodness. Excellent red sauce that's sweet and a little acidic.
The pizza is ideal for 2-3 people. They also offer pizza by the slice and some interesting brunch pizzas during the weekends.
Breezy Town is located inside the Clock Out Lounge. You order at the back of the bar and can order drinks at the bar or from the staff. There's plenty of seating and the inside of the bar is nice and clean. If you love Deep Dish Midwestern Style pizza, you owe it to yourself to check it out."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ajey L.","So glad we finally tried this place. Everything was delicious, the service was great, and the restaurant is just the right mix of classy but laid back.
We had the oysters, fried tomatillos, pickles, and king crab corndog to start. The oysters and tomatillos were fantastic, but the corndog was out of this world. I will come back just for that corndog. I cant even describe how much joy you get with every bite. We went with the crab spaghetti and the roast duck as our mains, and they were equally delightful. Everything we had was simple, but done really well, which can be hard to do.
We finished off with some champagne and the olive oil brownie, a must have if you've got a sweet tooth or are a fan of crackerjacks (they make their own and sprinkle it on top and its rad).
Our waitress was super attentive and gave us some great recommendations, and definitely made the experience 10/10.
We will definitely be back to try the new things on their menu, and about a dozen more corndogs."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","S H.","My husband and I thought we would try this place for brunch. First thoughts? The menu was a little precious, but we figured we give it a try. We should have know what we were in for when we took our first sip of coffee. So. Fricking. Bad. This is Seattle, man! We have really great coffee here! This was... memorably bad.
We discussed just paying for the coffee and leaving, but how bad could it get? Oh, honey...
I went ahead and ordered the Steak and Fried Egg and my husband ordered eggs, bacon and hash browns. Simple. Nothing too difficult. Or so we thought.
The bacon was burned and the hash browns were severely under cooked. And what's up with the pickles on top? I know the menu says pickled red onion, but pickled cucumbers?? The eggs were fine. A little overcooked, but edible. Sadly, the scrambled eggs were the high point of the meal.
When my dish was set in front of me, it looked okay, at first glance. Until I noticed the cook on the steak. I ordered it medium rare and what I got was just this side of breathing. The server was very apologetic, and they took everything back for a do over. When I finally got my dish back, and moved the eggs off the top of it, I saw that the steak had a giant ribbon of fat running down the center. Pale white, greasy, and altogether unappetizing. It was really bad. I'm not sure who they have to do their quality control, but this was an epic fail.
At this point, the only thing I can say was that they didn't screw up my husband's eggs to terribly. We did get apologies and only had to pay for his eggs and the coffee, so there's that. Will we ever give them another shot? Chances are very very slim."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","My husband and I came this past Saturday and I'm not sure if it's extreme to say that this is our new favorite restaurant in Seattle. The service was pleasant and attentive. We also had great food recommendations. The ambience was casual but sort of LA with plants everywhere, even in the bathrooms.
I ordered the mezcal cocktail, which was literally on fire. The smoky smell was a bit overwhelming but the drink tasted delicious. Appetizers, we ordered oysters, fried egg plant and clams. For the main dish we split the crab chitarra, which a nice server explained was the word for guitar because the spaghetti was like guitar strings. The pasta had a perfect spice to it and I thought about it most days since I've had it.
Overall I think the food was all thoughtfully made, service was excellent, and menu was well priced. We will be back very soon."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lauren G.","Came for brunch Saturday morning around 10:30am and was seated right away, wasn't crazy busy or anything. I don't know if it was just our server or the way their service typically, is but beware if you want a quick brunch...
My partner ordered the special which was prime rib hash which could have been amazing but was sadly dry and overcooked. The sauce was bright brought everything together though there could have been more of it. I ordered the wild rice and quinoa bowl which was tasty! I liked the pickled golden beets.
The dish that caught us by surprise though was the horchata pain perdue! It was massive and so delicious. The bread was so soft and the flavors were amazing altogether. It's definitely a sharing dish unless you have a massive breakfast sweet tooth!
I'd come back to try out their dinner menu. It's definitely a cute space but hopefully our super slow service was just a one time thing."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Angie A.","We were quite excited to try Eight Row reading about it on Eater. Well well well. It was disappointing. For the 2 of us, we ordered 4 dishes.
-Fried Eggplants: yummm! I do like this dish and recommend it.
-Rockfish Ceviche: can use more brightness and acid. Good amount of heat from jalapeños. The fish itself has a bit funny texture like not good cut.
-Pumpkin Gnocchi: great flavors. I really enjoy the mushrooms, roasted and pickled! Gnocchis were really super soft. At first I thought it was raw! I recommend this dish as well.
-Spaghetti Alla Chitarra: Dungeness crab spaghetti. This dish is the most disappointing of all the 4 we ordered. Pasta cooked nice and al dente. Can't barely see any crab meats. They were very small and mushy crab that looked and tasted like canned crab! Not worth $25. We didn't order any alcohol. Our total before tips was $90.
Atmosphere of restaurant is very comfortable, modern and lovely.
Service was good. Staffs : nice and helpful.
Great big space for big group.
Lots of street parking.
Overall, we are not in a hurry to come back to this restaurant. We can get better food with $90."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Margaret S.","Oh Eight Row.... how I wanted to love you. And maybe someday I will! But for now... its 3 stars.
Came in for dinner on a Friday night a few weeks back. Kind of late, around 8:30 so it wasn't too busy. Décor is cute. I like that they've brightened the place up from the previous Lucia vide. Initial greeting from the hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly (had a reservation). My overall feeling on this place is that it has good potential and a lot of room to grow. The menu reflects a well thought out approach but some of the flavors in the dishes just didn't quite make sense for me. I love simple, I love complex, I love great food. But if you're going to attempt to elevate your menu with more complexity, you need to do it right. If the components in the dish don't jive, its just an over complicated plate which wasn't well executed.
We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert. Food reviews as follows:
Seared Calamari - Not your typical, which was exciting. This was calamari stuffed with chorizo. That part was good! I enjoyed the flavor combo. The accompaniments however (carrot puree, mint), didn't seem to pair well in my opinion. Room for improvement.
Black Cod Ceviche - Enjoyed this, fish was fresh and it did have an overall ""bright"" theme to the dish. Some of the pickled items and the overuse of mint didn't quite make sense with the other items but I understand the direction they were going in.
Duck Breast - Gahhh. Was so on the fence with this dish. I wanted to love it because the duck was actually cooked perfectly. The skin, my fav was on point but it was way over salted :( and I can handle salt, love salt but even this was a little much for me. The rest of the dish was good overall, nothing which made me scream wow, but nice texture combos with the wild rice and the mostarda and decent depth of flavor.
Hanger Steak - Best part of this dish was the sunchokes. Steak and chimichurri were underwhelming and under seasoned. Maybe just not the spot for steak.
Olive Oil Brownie - Im a sucker for dessert! and I love olive oil anything. The server sold us on this, indicating that the olive oil kept the brownie super moist, almost gooey. Uh, not the case. This baby was dry. But luckily the sweet cream ice cream was delightful and gave the brownie some moisture assistance.
This was a tough review to right because at first glance I think this place should be 5 stars and I can appreciate the creative dishes their going for. Just didn't feel the value was there at this time. I do think i'll give this place another try (and hopefully update my review) as they do serve brunch and i'm always down for a great brunch.
Until next time Eight Row!"
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kate A.","I live a block away, so when Eight Row popped up I visited the first week. I've also been back a couple more times for dinner and once for brunch. It's a real gem. It's nice to have something a little more elevated in the Greenlake area!
Some dishes I highly recommend are the Venison + Pork Sausage, the Honey Glazed Half Smoked Chicken, the local lettuces (such a perfect yet simple salad to pair with anything you order!) and you can't go wrong with the oysters- very fresh and perfectly chilled.
The hangar steak and crab salad was just OK to me- I felt like my steak was pretty tough to chew and didn't seem like it was salted let alone seasoned. Beautiful presentation nevertheless.
Their wine selection is alright. I believe there was only one option by the glass for each type of wine which is fine- but I'd be pleased if they rotate or swap those out because the Cabernet Sauvignon option they offered didn't wow me. Their Rozella drink is delicious if you're in the mood for something fruity. It's just the right amount of sweet/tart/refreshing/satisfying. The Bellini at brunch is great too!
If you're there for brunch I suggest the Horchata Pain Perdu for something sweet- it's amazing! Tip: split it with someone. It's massive and even half of it left me feeling quite indulged. The fried oyster hash is also good and a very unique dish at that! Loved both. Can't wait to try more brunch items!
I've always had pretty great service here. The staff is polite and professional and you can tell they believe in the food and the chef. The space is bright and clean, it could even stand to be a little more dimly lit in the evenings in my opinion but that's no reason to complain. Solid 4 stars and I could see a few tweaks earning it a 5th star easily!
Will be back soon to try the squash and pumpkin dishes yum"
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mitchell V.","I think it has a lot of potential.
The hostess was incredibly kind and got us going with some cocktails while we waited for a table.
Everyone said the best dish was the eggplant so we got that and some broccoli to start. The eggplant was fine, I think it was overhyped. However, the brócoli was killer. It rested on a smearing of tarragon alioli. It was perfect for the charred brócoli.
This was followed by the crab noodles (reaaaaally salty), whole trout (good but missed the mark big time with the skin being soft and not crispy) and ended with the brick chicken which was actually really juicy and flavorful.
It was good but not cheap, would like to go back for happy hour."

Understand that I am buying the atmosphere but I feel pressured not to give a better rating but perhaps the anticipation to the taste is too high.

"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristen B.","Stoped in with a friend for her birthday. We started with the cornuts and it was okay but nothing spectacular. I ordered a drink on happy hour and it was okay but very strong whiskey taste ( if you love whiskey it was the cherry sour and you would probably love it ) Good deal considering only two drinks on happy hour.
I ordered the pickle appetizer and it took over 30 min to come out, the manager said she would comp due to the time. My friend ordered the pasta and she really liked it. I ordered a salad and it was tasty but again a little underwhelmed but the shaved vegetables were unique and good. The pickles finally came and it was all different veggies pickled and the green beans were a flavor explosion so delicious spicy and pickled.
We ended with a piece of cherry pie and it was delicious neither too sweet or tangy. The manager brought out ice cream from Lopez Island for my friends birthday and it was yummy. Overall a 4 star experience it was expensive and the happy hour menu underwhelming the pickles were 10 star with all the different flavors and love pickled vegetables. I will be back excited this is in the hood the hangar steak a nearby table looked delicious."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tanya H.","Sadly this turned out to be a disappointing dining experience.
Initially we were excited by the prospect of a new green lake restaurant, and all the more excited when we saw it was getting well reviewed.
We decided to try to it out on a Saturday night as we wanted to go somewhere local. Service was welcoming and the space is really nice. Felt quite summery with all the plants.
I had the local lettuce salad with champagne vinaigrette. It was so bitter that I could only eat half of it. The endives had somehow made everything in the salad really bitter including the shaved carrot. Very strange. Definitely a flavor fail.
For my main I had the pumpkin gnocchi which was generally pretty good though undersalted (which is not something I normally complain about).
So overall didn't love my meal and my husband felt similarly about his meal. The other big issue is the price. It cost $170 incl service for two starters, two mains and a cocktail and 2 glasses of wine. That seems an awful lot for a local restaurant. Especially when the ambitiousness of their menu does not meet expectations."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","William L.","Nice environment! Went here for dessert with my friends and had a great time. I wIll say that I went a tad underdressed so feel free to throw on a sweater instead of a sweatshirt."

Then there is the food. HOLY COW! So very good. I got their chicken dish which was off the hook good. My husband got a steak dish also amazing. Just know that when you eat here your bill is going to be heavy. It's expensive but worth every single penny."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Candi K.","Came here with a brunch with a friend and her 2 year old on a Sunday and I'm glad that I made reservations as it was pretty full by the time I sat down. Just FYI if you have kids, they don't have high-chairs but was able to snag a booth which worked ok for the kid. I would say their brunch menu is made up of 25% breakfast and 75% lunch so if you want breakfast food, you might not be satisfied here. Also, prices are pretty high considering most items don't come with hash browns, eggs, etc.... and for the French toast it's literally a huge chunk of bread, while delicious was $15 with just topping and syrup (some fruit would of been nice). I got the eggs benedict and it was delicious and welcomed the side salad but again, I can see some people wanting ""breakfast"" food.
Service was ok, I was waiting for my friend to show up and got seated early but would of been nice to have been brought water or asked if I wanted anything to drink (really needed coffee) and waited about 10 minutes until I was acknowledged."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Molly I.","Wandered down here on a Sunday evening with a good friend.
Food was delicious. As a vegetarian, they had a decent offering - which I always appreciate. We ordered an Endive and Pear Salad (they happily swapped the dressing here since the one it came with had anchovies in it), and some Pumpkin Gnocchi. I asked the waitress if it would be enough, since it seemed a small-plate situation, and she suggested we order another item, so we went for the Roasted Broccoli. Everything we ate was delicious. The Gnocchi was light and tender, the broccoli zingy in the best way, and the salad refreshing. But two plates would have been plenty.
We decided to celebrate with dessert - an Olive Oil Brownie that was executed wonderfully.
Really the ONLY thing keeping this place from 5 stars was the incessant high pitched ringing that is apparently a result of them having the heater and the music on at the same time ... That was just horrific. Almost had us out of our minds. If I'd been there with my husband, rather than friend, I know he would've have been able to stand it and we would have had to leave.... So go on a warm day, when the heater isn't necessary. At least until they get that resolved."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Beth Anne S.","We got to enjoy dinner here just after the grand opening. The atmosphere is delightful and allows for easy conversation. The staff keep everything super clean- even the bathrooms were spotless!
We ordered the clams, Hangar Steak, and the chicken dish! The clams came in a delicious broth that was such a welcomed break from typical clam broths. The broth was packed with flavors that really partnered well with the clams. The steak and chicken were cooked to perfection! We were thrilled when the chef, David Nichols, brought us a Crab Corndog. Sounds crazy but, it was a delicious bread batter stuffed full of fresh crab meat. The picture shown was after several bites. It is presented like the most elegant corn dog you have ever seen!
Overall, this was a perfect date night! We will be back for sure.
Some other reviews talk about being overpriced but, for the quality, and taste of the food, the welcoming staff, and wonderful ambiance, it's worth every penny!

""Proactive"" !conclusion: Looks like a really nice place for intro to new books and pizza and whine with Fettuccine Alfredo with lots to go for the fridge!
I am also curious about the Gyros because I have many friends that love Gyros! and are always looking for quality places!
PS. I should make it my project goal for next time to try the front -banner --""Parking in rear alley access off 64'th""!

"Olympic Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/olympic-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David X.","Wow. I had to personally thank the chef on this one, a tiny old man with a sparkle in his eye, and his wife, presumably, right next to him making pasta. Who would have thought this tiny hole in the wall would have such good food. I am a traditionalist and stick to the classics - fettuccine Alfredo, lasagna, chicken parmigiano, S&M... I choose the FetAlf sans chicken.
Now, I used to work at a very high end Italian restaurante in Los Angeles, celebrity chef and all, and it was the second best I've ever had outside of an Italian restaurant in Northern Japan, go figure, but Olympia Pizza comes in at a solid 3rd on my list of world favorites.
Kudos and yes, I'll be back"

The pizza is awesome, and being that the owners are from Crete, some of the best Greek food around you're going to find.
Warm atmosphere inside, and their bar area looks exactly like what you would find in a typical taverna in Crete."

The garlic bread was dry and hard by the time we ate it. The pizza (we had the special) was ok. I just prefer a sweeter more substantial crust and the toppings just became soggy under the solidified cheese. But, my husband took it home and ate it for lunch, so 3 stars it is!"

I ordered the special of the day, the greek lasagna, which I didn't really care for, but that may simply be my tastes for lasagna. It was good food, and would go back again, but it didn't blow my socks off, so I'm going 4-stars."

Came in with a group on a Saturday night and pretty much ordered most of the menu to share:
the winners:
- Brussels sprouts- roasted, crispy, with a bit of tang from the glaze, makes eating your veggies a great idea
- hammered potatoes- thick potato slices served with a yummy combo of textures from creamy aioli to crunchy pickled onion... definitely a great sharing plate
- saffron fried rice- special of the night with chicken and chorizo, definitely a favorite for the table
- squash al pastor tacos- surprising combo of savory squash with a little sweetness from pineapple that came together with the crema
- fish tacos - crispy, lightly fried cod topped with a delicious tomatillo aioli
Runner ups:
- chimichurri Mac & cheese - good flavor with nice crunch from the breadcrumbs but a little dry
- brisket & cornbread- the cornbread was actually arepas which were good but a little dense. The brisket was tender and the crema was a nice balance
Every plate was scraped clean so clearly no complaints, will definitely be back to wrap up the few items left on the menu to try."

Bartenders are still very friendly and serve great cocktails! We got a Dead Line (with activated charcoal!) and Glass full of hugs (because I like hugs and bourbon!) and they were both really delicious and well-balanced.
We ordered the arepitas and brussel sprouts to start and had the squash al pastor and chorizo tacos to share for dinner. The arepitas were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with just enough sauce on the dish. It was hard not to lick the plate. The brussel sprouts are perfectly charred with a balsamic glaze to die for. Yum! The squash al pastor tacos were tender and well-seasoned... enough that you didn't miss the meat! The chorizo tacos were also well-seasoned with awesome pineapple salsa and pickled jalapenos.
I asked James about some of their Scotch selections and Chris came over to chat with us about their selection of Scotch and whiskey. We got to talking about their selections, some of their favorite bars in the area, and Chris also gave us some samplings of their delicious goods.
I left well fed and warm with delicious drinks in my belly. Thanks James and Chris!"

I was in fact looking for a place that I could do parties, there was a huge birthday part going on upstairs in the room. It was very adorable, the decorations, the set up was in AWH.

The potatoes were roasted from the outside and soft from the inside. Since I am vegetarian they made vegetarian tacos for me. The vegetarian tacos had smoked cauliflower, red peppers, pineapple, and potatoes. These tacos were kind of spicy in flavor but were really good. The non vegetarian food was really good too according to my friends. They did not have a lot of food options but had a lot of beverage options.
The kitchen was open and you could see the chef make your food. The restroom was really clean and modern."

The venue was named for the line of demarcation between the rebuilt section of Seattle and the old section that was destroyed by fire back in the 20th century. The address (114 First Avenue) was at one time home to a New Orleans-style Cajun/Creole restaurant.
If you're a person that enjoys a good cocktail than the expert mixologists working behind the bar here will totally be singing your song! They can make some of the best classic cocktails, or deftly mix herbs, seasonal juices and exotic liquors to craft an original creation upon request.
Tip: They have a daily Happy Hour here from 4-6pm which features complimentary ""small bites"" with all beverage orders.
The cuisine here is Latin with a decidedly South American slant. While It's pretty much impossible to go wrong regardless of the dish you choose, I highly recommend their burgers, which have a very nice kick to them :-)
While all the cocktails I've tried here were delicious, I especially enjoyed the ""Dead Line"" signature cocktail - I highly recommend that you stop in for one."

The entire time, all of the staff was very friendly and helpful. They even let me order off the happy hour menu a few minutes past the deadline (not living up to the name).
The food here was really good. I tried the hammered potatoes with brisket, tacos with brisket as they were out of chorizo, and roasted cauliflower. The hammered potatoes were my favorite. Perfectly crispy, delicious toppings, and a well rounded flavor profile. The three dishes I ordered all kind of had the same ingredients and taste in a way, even though they all tasted good.
The drinks were fun. I got my standby, an old fashioned. It was good. I followed that with the titular dead line. Not my favorite, as it tasted a little like Gatorade, but it wasn't bad and I like trying new concoctions. Finally I got a sazerac in honor of my home state. All the drinks were a bit on the weaker side. I wish they had a bit more punch overall.

It was pretty packed, I guess the local Chinese community already knows about this place.
I originally ordered the spare ribs with rice to-go, but changed to dine-in once I saw a table open up. I proceeded to take a seat after waiting 10 minutes or so, thinking my food would come out soon. About 20 minutes later, a server brought me a soy-sauce-marinated egg, apologizing for the wait and telling me my food would be out soon.
In total, I waited around 45 minutes before my food finally came out. By then, the restaurant was close to empty, and it was close to closing time. However, despite the food taking so long, I'm glad I wasn't rushed to eat quickly.
My food came out in a large steamer, and it looks like a lot of food at first. However, the steamer is pretty shallow, and so the food just thinly spread out. Quantity-wise, it was perfect for one person.
One thing that was unique was that they put banana leaves under the dish as it steams, imparting a unique aroma that I've never seen in other rice and sparerib dishes. I didn't necessarily add anything flavor-wise, but I just thought it was interesting.
The spare ribs, though tender, did not pack any flavor at all. The same could be said about the rice - it just tasted bland. I had to almost drench the whole thing in soy sauce to taste anything remotely satisfying. They did give a good amount of bok choy, which I appreciate. But that wasn't enough to offset the taste of the primary components of the dish.
Pricing is a bit high (12.95 for a rice dish) for my liking. Maybe if the food was a little more flavorful, I'd be okay with it. But I can't see that price point justified as of now.
The decor itself is pretty nice. It's sleek and modern, and very well lit. There's a huge TV inside playing Chinese tv shows/dramas, but that didn't do anything for me since I can't read/understand Chinese.
It's not the biggest restaurant - there are maybe 10-15 tables that can fit around 4 people, so try not to come in a large group. There's also a few bar seats, but it gets tight at the bar from what I've seen.
It's located in the Asian Family Market plaza, which gets really busy on weekends. Weekdays, it's manageable. There are tons of parking spots, it's just a matter of when you go that'll determine how easy parking will be.
I think I'll still go to Chinatown if I want my spare ribs and rice dishes, at least, until this place makes some upgrades to compete with my regular options."

For as busy as the place was, there were only 2 servers. While they were very nice, the service was lacking. No refills on water, half the food came out together then the rest of the dishes came out one by one at least 10 minutes apart with the last dish coming out when everyone else had finished.
That beIng said, the food was ok. The skewers were flavorful but the rice dishes were pretty bland. The sauce that was provided didn't help either.
Overall a disappointing experience given the amount of time we waIted. Can't say that I will go back."

Unfortunately, after an hour wait, when we got there, we were somehow farther behind in line than when we started. The staff told me yelp waitlist was broken but since I had waited an hour they bumped me to the front of the line. Very nice of them.
We ordered the Chinese Ham Sausage lotus leaf rice. You can really smell the lotus leaf fragrance in the rice. It was cooked perfectly and the sausage wasn't overly oily. The bokchoy was not overcooked and still had a slight crunch. Would definitely recommend this.
Also got some BBQ skewers: lamb and shrimp with quail egg. These were not bad. Nicely seasoned but slightly forgettable. Lamb was also a little tough.
The seaweed salad was really good and had a nice bit of spice in it.
The service was very friendly but they were clearly incredibly busy. Sometimes you had to flag them down to take an empty plate from your table or to provide you with things like bowls for sharing but they were always happy to help.
Unfortunately, someone spilled some hot sauce on my fiancé's coat that was hanging behind her on her chair. We didn't notice it until later that day but luckily we got it out.
Overall, their lotus leaf rices are nicely done and worth a visit."

During its soft opening stage, there is not a sign outside yet. It's next to MonGa Café if you go now.
As of today, they opened only 4 to 5 days ago. I joined the waitlist via Yelp and was told the wait was 16 to 31 minutes. It was more like an hour. That's ok; I guessed that would happen and was mentally prepared. If you don't like crowds or lines, it's better to give it some time.
Within the Yelp reviews, you'll find the owner's own summary of his restaurant. In short, it's his comfort food, particularly the lotus leaf rice dishes, which is essentially your must-order food here. We had the chicken and mushroom and the garlic sparerib. A soy-sauce based mixing sauce (similar to a Chinese style dumpling sauce) is provided. Drizzle on this sauce, mix well, and enjoy. Eat like ""a local"" by eating with the spoon. ;) Both dishes were filling and satisfying. I would love to see a try vegetarian option in this category. A bok choy, mushroom, and maybe egg (sunny side up) and corn would be great. I also would welcome at least one more seafood options; would love to see a garlic shrimp with chopped bits of garlic visible.
They also have a good set of options in their BBQ section (served after 6pm). We wanted the quail egg shrimp, but they were sold out. We ordered the fish balls instead. They are lightly seared, and there's a seasoning on it (possibly cumin). Yummy. We also ordered their tea eggs - very flavorful. I highly recommend this appetizer.
Prices are reasonable, especially the rice dishes. I suspect this place has a good future. Give them a try, though maybe at a less busy hour. There was no more lines by 7:45pm on a Friday.
Service was surprisingly good on a very busy night. 3 guys handled the front, speaking English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Despite the wait and the crowd, it was still a good meal overall."

I don't believe they have their signage up or at least I didn't see any when I came in tonight.
Braised Pork Belly over steamed rice - 3/5 Very light in flavor so make sure you drizzle some of their homemade soy sauce for added flavor. Pork/fat ratio: 10% pork & 90% fat. It was too fatty for my taste.
Shredded Potatoes 2/5 - Not much flavor. It wasn't even mildly spicy nor vinegary. It's a good palate cleanser for the fatty pork belly.
Beef skewers 1/5 - Lightly salted and it came with a side of dried seasoning (mild crush chili powder and cumin) for dipping. Beef was cut in small cubes and a bit tough.
Fish ball skewers 2/5- I was expecting it to be grilled or something but it wasn't. They basically cut the fish ball in half and pierced it through the skewer with light dusting of the same seasoning (mild crush chili powder and cumin). It also came with an extra side of the same seasoning on the plate.
Crispy Milk Curd - 2/5 It's hard for me to describe what this tastes like. The texture reminds of flavorless, soft jello with a somewhat crispy crust drizzled with condensed milk on the top. Since there wasn't much flavor to it, they should have served it with a side of condensed milk for dipping.
Service: 1/5 - There were 5-6 waiters working tonight which I thought was a good sign but quickly realized they prefer to chit chat amongst themselves than to attend to their customers. We had to flag someone down to take our order after being seated for over 10min. At the end of our meal, we had to vigorously wave at them to get their attention to bring us our bill. Someone finally came and cleaned only half of table and decided to get back to their group convo. I really hope they'll improve their service soon."

As of right now I think they taste a bit blend and their price point is a bit high (12.95 for a rice dish, 10.95 for 4 wings, 5.95 for a small pot of soup)
However, I am still giving this restaurant a 4 stars due to the fact that they are different than most other Chinese restaurants here. They are serving steam dishes with very basic ingredients. Nothing is soaked in spicy oil and chili pepper, I feel 10 times healthier eating here.
I hope they try different things to make their rice dishes a bit more flavorful. I will continue to visit this store."

-----
Randomly stumbled upon this place on a rainy Sunday and boy am I glad. My group of 4 came just before noon and were able to get seated in less than 10 minutes without reservation. However, it became pretty packed soon after and they actually sold out of their dishes around 1pm.
I believe the restaurant is still in its soft opening stage so there were definitely some kinks they need to work through. The services can be slow at times (we had to ask for water multiple times) and the server forgot one dish we ordered. But the food made up for it.
We got the lotus leaf steamed rice with chicken and mushroom, steamed rice with pork belly, seaweed salad, fried chicken wings and lamb skewer.
The steam rice dishes were phenomenal and I'd definitely come back for them. While they looked very simple, they sure hit the spot, so did the seaweed salad. The lamb skewers were pretty standard and kinda expensive imo.
The only thing we didn't like was the fried chicken wings ($10 for 4 pieces btw!!). The wings looked good in picture but they were overly grease-y and sweet?! I think they were either battered using a dessert batter (they do serve a fried milk dessert thingy), or fried in the same fryer as the dessert. We asked if they are supposed to be sweet and the owner said yes... so maybe my palate is just not refined enough :S"

I find myself always craving clay pot rice dishes. Although they do not serve their rice dishes in clay pots and thus you miss out on the crispy rice pieces, I would argue the banana leaf addition is a worthy substitute.
They make their own sauce to mix into the rice and it's so impressive. I was afraid the sauce would overpower the rice flavors or make the dish too salty but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it actually complimented the dishes perfectly!
Will definitely be going back to try all of their dishes :)"

Lots of good options for meat and veggie dishes, plus lots of flavors! This place needs to expand its eating area as it is really only good for parties of 4 or less. There were 6 of us and it was very squished! The servers were excellent, all smiles, and very fast! The biggest negative is that the parking for this area is a nightmare! Very little parking for so many businesses. Uber drop off may make this a better experience. Overall really good restaurant with good food!"

Disclaimer: my wife knows the owner and we were invited to 'test drive' before they are open to public this week.
We are family of five with 3 small kids, we ordered 5 different lotus leave steamed rice (we couldn't finished them), 2 types of bbq lamb, few homemade drinks, chatting with the owner and watching them working hard to get the restaurant ready for soft opening the second day.
We are Malaysian Chinese and has been living in many different places. The difficulty is always about looking for great Asian restaurant where they serve good authentic food, with fresh ingredients, which you can taste the cooking and ingredients, rather than just the over flavoring.
I must say this is exactly what Luna Bistro is offering. The lotus leave steamed rice we tasted are all really delicious, is a way that how a family would cook at home (if you have time to prepare). It's refreshing almost coming from most Asian restaurant, that i can taste the pork, the chicken, the steam vegetables , along with the steam rice with the natural fragrance of the lotus leave steamed with it. Oh! Please try the minced pork steam rice, the owner recommended it, I am not normally a minced pork person (as it always get over flavored), but the one served here is phenomenal for us!
And then the bbq lamb, the skewer come with great flavorful dry hot spices for 'dipping', that is amazing, the bbq lamp chop (3x single lamb rack) is juicy and good balance of flavor - I wish I am here not with family but with just friends and having these with beers!
The portion is good to the price, we only managed to finished like 3 out the 5 portioned of the steamed rice, we are small eater though with small kids, so now we have steamed rice for Sunday lunch at home.
Upon finishing our fantastic dinner, owner came by again for feedback, we share our great experience with some small practical suggestions here and there (cutlery for kids, reservation for family, etc), and our concern - maybe his has too few tables, he should start looking for expansion!"

I've been out of the foodie scene in Seattle for awhile and hadn't heard of it, and when the name came up in a yelp search I groaned. ""Oh lord, another twee hipster place with inconsistent food and overly pedantic service!"" is what I thought.
But I read the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a go, even though we had no reServations. The place wasn't full but it was busy, and when I said i had a party of two but no rezzies they pointed me to the bar, which frankly is where I would rather eat anyways. (Pro tip: you can nearly always sneak a seat for dinner at the bar in a good popular restaurant. It's the only way I will eat at the Met.)
So, I sit down and the bartender asks if I want sparkling or still water. Well dammit that's a nice touch. Then the beer I want is out, but they load a new keg for, quickly and without rancor. Also nice.
Then the food! We had the charcuterie, oysters, octopus, steak and split a panna cotta for dessert. I usually look for one standout, one solid and then give the place credit if the worst dish is something I could probably do better at home.
Every dish was very, very good. Very good. Service was thorough and attentive without being cloying. And for Seattle the bill wasn't horrifying!
The only thing I can complain about is the vibe, and it's a minor complaint. The decorations and design are ""neutral"" in the best and worst senses of the word: they don't get in the way of really great food (yay!) But they are boring (boo!).
I will absolutely come here again!"

Service was Ok, had to ask for bread a few times, however initially was not even offered bread/butter. Seems like it arrives upon 2nd request.
Food was good, but portions for the price are stingy. Plate with beef cheeks came out with one side of the plate super hot, another side luke warm. Indicator that the food was not made to order, but heated to order. Amatuer move.
The kicker- even for 3 people 20% mandatory tip is already included.
Why 20%? Why not 18 or 21? Tip is supposed to be something that is valuated arbitrarily based on individual experience. An incentive, if you will, for wait staff to be on point.
The bill conveniently had a line for Tip, that is in addition to already mandated 20% and the wait staff sheepishly never mentioned that aspect. In other words, they will gladly take your money if you are not looking at the check details. Pretty shady business practice if you ask me. Will not be coming back.
To the management - if you have specific to say, I would like to hear. You token ""Our apologies, regret, your dining experience, tips are going to xyz"" and the rest of corporate phrases - please save them.
It was a Friday evening 7:00 PM, place was pretty empty, left around 9:00 PM, it was still emptier than ever......"

We got Uber as they don't have valet and figured to be drinking a bit more than usual for this occasion.
The front of the house has a bar and dinner seating toward the back of the house. It was packed in the front bar area with large groups enjoying happy hour and the ambiance was this is a good place to have after work drinks and good cheer.
We skipped the party and went past the open kitchen where you smell a light touch of wood smoke from there free standing pizza oven. It immediately made me think of eating smoked ribs even though not on the menu.
The cocktails are serviced using artisan ice that is crystal clear that provides a nice touch, as you can see in the photos of the ""Usual"" rye whiskey drink. The beet salad, seared albacore, steak tartar and oysters where our starters that were well executed and just the right portions so you can still have room for the entrees. I saw a good cross section of the entrees; octopus, sea scallops, beef cheek and seared lingcod with me having the scallops.
The staff handling the seating and table service are top notch here and very professional. A covey of staff clear the entire table in one go between courses showing a great deal of organization. You should not come away disappointed from the point of sitting down until you leave from the execution of providing you a great dinner experience.
I'm pretty sure the bill for this meal was from my perspective over-the-top, but it was nice having such a great experience without the bitter taste of paying up the additional 30% tax & service charges on top. This said, Heartwood Provisions has an excellent staff and food that well deserves the service charge.
As we left our guests, we couldn't resist hang out at the bar for another ""the usual"" and chatting up the bartender before we Uber'd our way back to the Burien non-hipster zone below the West Seattle bridge."

The beef jerky starter was good, nice flavor, Got tight into dinner ordered a scrumptious octopus meal complimented with Brussels sprouts, the sprouts were melt in your mouth delicious, my first shot at octopus and I was not disappointed, this was served on top of ink fried rice and Chinese sausages with some other tasty greens and aioli, tantalizing to the tastebuds, my wife ordered linkcod it came out cool sent it back and they flash fired it, not good, still just warm, she ended up not being able to eat it, staff was nice and removed it from our bill but now the wife is still hungry, a bit dissatisfied with that.

LOL). It was the closest restaurant to where we were walking. Although it looks like a posh/fancy place, and we were dressed very casual, the host didn't flinch when we walked in and was happy to welcome us. We selected the bar and ordered our drinks. The bartenders were super nice and easy to talk to. Since I am new in town, we were asking many questions about what to do in town for fun, the culture around town, neighborhoods to hang out etc. They gave us advice and tips on how to get places etc. The conversations and interactions made me feel at ease. The bartenders were the highlight of my night. I will definitely be back soon and next time I'll have some food.
The khaleesi is a very good drink. Also I heard that one of Andrew's specialty is the Ramos Gin Fizz, so I will be back for that drink (one of my favorite)."

The cocktail, although I don't remember the name, was kind of like an old fashioned and tasted great.

We had a double date here to celebrate some friends from out of town as well as our gentleman's birthday.
I really like that their menu is focused on pairing the food with an adult beverage (wine, beer or spirits).
FOODwise:
-Beet salad is divine! Seriously.
-Wild Sea Scallops (you can never go wrong with seafood in Seattle).
-Brussels Sprouts were a great side with any of the entrees we had on the table.
-Octopus was one of the better entrees with the Mezcal pairing.
-Smoked Caramel Panna Cotta came out with a birthday candle on-the-house for dessert.
The service was a 10/10 for us.
The champagne that was being poured at the beginning of our meal was just the touch of luxury we enjoy.
A definite must in downtown Seattle if you're looking for a quality dining experience."

Luckily, work decided to host a dinner for us there so I finally got to try it! And it did not disappoint.
We shared a bunch of salads to start and they were delicious. I then ordered the scallops and they were divine. Perfectly cooked, with this delicious kind of sweet corn-esque sauce. Yum!! I was so full, but I wanted more of that sauce. The broccolini side was perfectly grilled, and people loved the potatoes gratin. The desserts were also yummy! The panna cotta was overly sweet, but I couldn't stop eating it! Service was fantastic and they never kept us waiting. I'll have to try it sometime on my own, but here's hoping work takes us to Heartwood Provisions again!"

-The oysters with Mezcal are amazing, definitely recommend.
-Apple and pear salad is really nice and light. A great starter.
-I was in between the Squash and Halibut, and Im glad I got the Halibut. The fish is amazing, the mushrooms were an incredible added texture, and the ponzu butter is delicious.
-The Smoked Caramel Panna Cotta is so good. Not my usual go to dessert but the server recommended it, and he was right.
Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Plus if you're staying at the Loews it's only a block away.
Also, pretty good happy hour!"

I liked the vibe of the restaurant, especially the bar - I could see coming back for drinks. The cocktails were 5 stars - both ""The Usual"" and ""Summer in Provence"" hit the spot.
After that, our food was just ""OK"", and didn't come close to hitting the price point. My wife loved the spring salad - great blend of flavors. I had the foie gras - pretty good, but not $20 good... we then split the pork chop, which I was excited for. However, we ended up disappointed, as it was really fatty! I cut off at least 25% of the weight of the cut. At $35-40, I need to be blown away and that wasn't it :(

Big pieces of fork tender beef brisket on top of cheesy fries. Amazing. Seafood stew-nice creamy texture full of fresh tomato flavor and spices. Beet salad- sooo good.

Reservation is recommended! Place is spacious but tends to be fully booked.
I came here both during SRW and regular dinner service so I'd say I have a solid judgment for this place.
*Smoked Cod Brandade (SRW)
According to the mighty google, brandade is an ""emulsion of salt cod and olive oil."" You're supposed to use it as a spread on a warm bread. I thought it was pretty good, well seasoned and had that smoky flavor.
*Grand Central Bread w/ Duck Fat Butter
Warm bread paired with fragrant duck fat butter? Yes please! The butter itself has distinct aroma and taste that I enjoy better than those of regular butter.
*Gruyère Potatoes
Potato gratin made using gruyère cheese and grain mustard. HEAVENLY! Enough said.
*Pork Belly (SRW)
Very tender and flavorful! The sweet roasted pear was a nice touch
*Roasted Scallop
I have mixed feeling about this dish. Scallops themselves are good but I don't think it meshed well with curry laksa sauce which didn't taste like laksa at all (resembles peanut sauce). Wasn't a big fan of the crispy ramen either. Overall, still good but wished it was cooked differently.
*Octopus
My gloom-ridden past experience with overly chewy octopus had left me wondering if this dish was even worth trying. In the end, I'm glad I made the RIGHT DECISION. It was so tender and seasoned well! The ink sofrito and tamarind created the right balance between savoriness and swetness of the sauce. The puffed rice, although I think was unnecessary, added another layer of texture to the dish.
*Smoked Caramel Panna Cotta
PHENOMENAL! One of the best desserts that I've had. The combination of brown butter apple, hazelnut crumbs, caramel pop corn, and vanilla ice cream elevates the overall flavor tenfold!
Service was attentive and amiable. Highly recommended!"

My boyfriend and I came here whilst out in downtown Seattle and realized we were near Heartwood Provisions, just at the right time. And when I say the right time, I mean happy hour! From 3-6pm everyday, you can partake in one of the best downtown happy hours, as drinks and food are offered at affordable prices.
I heard you're supposed to get a cocktail here, which I will totes do next time. But as soon as I learned there was a happy hour Bordeaux for only six bucks, you best believe I was about to get on that bandwagon, as Bordeaux wines are my absolute favorite kind of wines! Plus, The Burger was only 10 bucks, so c'mon! I had to order it, which made for an awesome Sunday supper.
As we waited for our food/dinner, we sipped on our Bordeaux and made friends with the bartender who could not have been nicer. He was making conversation with everyone at the bar, asking us how our day was and what brought us into Heartwood Provisions. I told him that I had heard about the happy hour burger here, which he confirmed was a crowd favorite. After telling him the Met has my favorite burger in downtown Seattle, he mentioned the Met was their sister restaurant. Of freaking course. It's a sign.
The Burger was fantastic! I seem to always be on the search for the best burger around town and the burger here measures up. It was definitely a large patty, cooked to medium-rare, with gruyere, arugula, pickled onion, horseradish aioli, all on a lightly-toasted brioche bun. Plus, the burger came with fries that were double-dipped, making them extra crunchy and oh-so-lovely with the horseradish aioli. Ask for a side of the aioli and nix the ketchup; your fries will thank you. I left feeling satisfied. It was a great early dinner/happy hour burger.
So glad to have finally made it to happy hour at Heartwood Provisions! Beautiful, yet inviting spot in downtown Seattle, with awesome eats and warm customer service. What's not to love?"

Honestly, I think it might be my new favorite restaurant in Seattle!
First of all, the restaurant is beautiful! I love the overall interior design and ambience. The food here is pretty amazing! Everything was super flavorful yet it had such a delicate touch, it blended perfectly together. All the dishes were presented beautifully as well. I wanted to explore their menu so we tried different dishes each time we went.
My favorites were:
- Octopus (soooo good!! I didn't think I liked Octopus that much until trying this dish)
- Chicken Thigh (has a burst of flavor and the chicken was cooked to perfection)
- Crispy Cauliflower (wow what a surprise! didn't think cauliflower could be this delicious)
- Beef Burger (yummmm, one of the best beef patty I've had and the horseradish aioli made it even better!)
- last but not least, SMOKED CARAMEL PANNA COTTA. (perfection of a dessert - it has all the deliciousness with different textures and temperature, it is a burst of amazingness in your mouth!!) hahaha

Nice relaxing ambiance with delicious food! The waitstaff was generally great - our waters were never empty. Left very hydrated lol.
I was a little disappointed with the server as he would walk by several times, look over at our table, and didn't address things that needed attending to (coffee refills, serving spoon for the appetizer, etc.) but would walk away quickly so we couldn't grab him. It also took an unusually long time to get our bill even though the waitstaff has our tables cleared for a while. We had to ask the server for our bills awkwardly though yet again he passed by many times.
Food... so delicious. I have never seen anchovies in Brussel sprouts before but it was zesty and delicious! My breakfast burger tasted great and so did my husband's pork shoulder hash. We will definitely come back again for the food!!"

It was very well balanced with soft poached egg, Chinese sausage (always a favorite with its saltiness and fattiness), sautéed greens, and fried wontons. The congee itself was infused with ginger flavor and was so smooth. Drizzled on top was a pimenton chili oil to add color and spice. I'm inspired to raise the bar for my homemade congee now! .
Other dishes we tried was a smoked pork shoulder hash. It had fried kale (what a great crispy element to add!), preserved lemon aioli, onion, and sunny side up eggs. We shared a small plate of brussel sprouts. It had tallow, pickled chili, white anchovy, and preserved aioli. The Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly. It was on the fine line of char where a second more it could be burnt but no it was done beautifully. I wish I could cook brussels like that!
Every dish that came out looked gorgeous. Every ingredient has its purpose to the plate to being the dish balance with acidity, texture and dimension. There was so much flavor in every dish. I was very happy with my decision to come here and will highly recommend to anyone. I want to come back and try more brunch or dinner options!"

We had a party of ~20 people are they were great at taking orders and delivering drinks and food in a timely manner.
If you are a tequila fan like myself, I highly recommend the Paloma. For happy hour eats, the poutine is a must-have. Brussell sprouts were good too!"

I ordered Rotating Punch. Our bar tender made me this very refreshing cocktail drink with dried lime. After a long walk at Pike Market it was really good. Great atmosphere and great conversations with our bar staff. Gave us sightseeing tips.

This review is specific to the most recent one during SRW.
My husband and I went in on a Tuesday evening for dinner. It wasn't their busy time and we received a lot of attention from our server.
We both ordered out of their SRW menu.
I had the cauliflower soup, trout for entree and panacotta for dessert.
The cauliflower soup really knocked my socks off. I didn't expect it to be so creamy. Just straight up brilliant. The entree portion size was slightly small but when had as a part of a three course meal, it works. The trout was seasoned ever so lightly but the pairing with the citrus and the crispy rice noodle worked very well.
Their take on the panacotta was very fresh.
There were peaches and english biscuit like crust. It was a heavy dessert.
The service was great and the ambience is perfect for a date night. Definitely recommend!!"
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christina R.","Delicious pizza (as well as pretty much everything on their menu - especially the Gorgonzola gnocchi, but I come for the pizza).
On top of the great food, the brothers who own Cornuto take thoughtful care in making those who drink and dine here feel welcome and well taken care of from the dishes offered, to the cocktails crafted and wine selected, to the ambiance provided.
I have eaten here countless times (and it's often a go-to to take out of town guests) and also hosted a dinner for fifteen guests for my birthday. From small gatherings to larger parties, this is an excellent place that makes any evening feel special.
Tip: Favorite spot to eat/drink in the winter is the bar, favorite spot to eat/drink in the summer is the back patio which boasts sunshine, balmy breezes, and beautiful hand crafted benches and tables (again, not to mention the delicious food)."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Heather H.","Delicious pizza and drinks for a tucked away spot! My only gripe is that for the size and price of the pizza is pretty dismal. I get that it's an artisanal pizza etc but that combined with one drink came out to over $35.00. Good food, just come prepared for some sticker shock at the end."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jillian E.","I love this place! First of all, the pizza is wonderful! And highly recommend the veal meatballs to start. If you are in a sharing mood, the gnocchi with Gorgonzola is also a good way to start a meal here:) the buffalina is prob my favorite. You can really taste the fresh tomato sauce and the creamy buffalo cheese. If ordering two pizzas, this is always one of them. Also a nice wine selection, Chianti is my go to. The Nutella calzone is a great way to end a meal if you've saved room. I was skeptical ordering but it is not overly sweet, well balanced amount of Nutella with dough and some fresh fruit. In the summer they have an outdoor deck in the back."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sasha K.","The food and ambience were amazing. We sat out on the back deck and while it was a little chilly, it was worth it! We god the Diavola pizza and added arugula along with the Tricolore salad and pesto gnocchi. Everything was great. I look forward to going f back soon!"
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marcela V.","Very cute date spot in the heart of Greenwood. They make everything right in front of you in the brick oven, which is very cool. Their wood fired pizza is really delicious & I loved the flavor on the crust. I ordered the Cipollina & my boyfriend ordered the spaghetti alle vongole. We watched them cook both our orders, they cook the clams in the wood oven & pour the clam juice right onto the pasta so it gets a really great flavor. The pizza was very tasty, I added mushrooms for a little extra flavor. My only complaint was that it was unclear that the pizza did not come with red sauce, it only had olive oil as the sauce. It still tasted great, it just wasn't what I expected. We also ordered a side of bread on the side for the pasta, so soak up the leftover clam sauce because it was so yummy. I also had a glass of wine that was just ok. Overall, I'd go back Cornuto for a nice date night. I'm not sure how it vibes with the rest of the spots in the neighborhood, which are more family oriented, this place is a bit more upscale."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Seattle M.","The pizza here is Neapolitan style, similar to Tutta Bella or Via Trublinali. I went here on an afternoon for the happy hour, but after reading the reviews about how small the hh pizza was and finding that it was only 6$ off the list price, it would make it $11 for a 9"" pizza, wow.
The full price pizza I got was Prosciutto which cost $17, it was barely 12"" maybe 11. Incredibly bland with little to no cheese and a very slim layer of 5 small pieces of prosciutto. I asked for extra sauce on the pizza, but it still came a bit dry so I asked for some on the side.
They charged me $1 for the sauce and $17 for a tiny mediocre pizza. I was amazed that they are in business. total or $24 for lunch and I was still hungry afterwards....:(
Great location with nice western sun and outside seating front and back. It's really too bad they are not making a better effort on the food."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mary W.","Cornuto is so cozy and inviting. I love the warm atmosphere and welcoming service almost as much as I love their wood-fired pizza. The perfect spot for date night! Cornuto has a new regular :)"
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Aaron R.","I called in to order takeout, but they said I couldn't place an order over the phone because they were ""too busy."" Oddly, they said I could walk in and place a takeout order. That's completely unacceptable and a waste of the customer's time. Seriously, what successful pizza place refuses to take phone orders, let alone whine to the customer that they're too busy? Do yourself a favor and get your pizza from somewhere else. These guys are apparently so busy they don't need your business. I called Razzis and they were more than happy to take my order."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thomas S.","I last reviewed this restaurant four years ago. When I was first dating my now-wife, this was a great place for a romantic and tasty date. It has only gotten better since then and this has become a favorite neighborhood spot to relax. The cocktails have improved, the vibe is just as cozy. In the summer, the back patio is a great place to sit and enjoy pizza and a drink. The pizza is still amazing and made as pizza should be. The service is top notch, with personal attention and care from each bartender and server."
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tori Z.","I'll admit it, if I didn't live around here I probably never would have found this place or come here, but it is awesome! Just a short walk from Greenlake, Cornuto is a stellar restaurant in Phinney Ridge. Aside from the pizza, they have an awesome bar. I love to come here late in the evenings because there is a bartender who makes a killer Amaretto Sour. I have also tried a few of their drink specials, and they never fail to be delicious. The wood fired pizza is also pretty good, if you're not too hungry a single pizza is enough to feed 2 people. I would definitely recommend this as a top restaurant and bar in the area that is decently priced too!"
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","stephanie x.","I'm a big fan of their happy hour pizza and carafes of house wine.

Scant ingredients...I ordered a pizza with prosciutto and basil, but the prosciutto was dry and came off in a single bite, and the basil - which tasted fresh - covered about 5% of the pie. $22 poorly spent on my opinion. :-/"

"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","RoseJean W.","Came here with my dad while he was visiting and initially I just thought it would be another artisan pizza place, but I was completely blown away. The pizza is just the way I like it, with a thin crust, but not so paper thin that it's a big cracker. Cocktails were spot on and the tiramisu was addictive. I got home and wished I had gotten some to go... still thinking about it weeks later.
But this review is more about the service, which I can confidently say was perfect. Josephine (blonde hair, early 20s), was one-hundred-percent accurate in anticipating our needs and offered us what we needed before we even knew we needed it. She was congenial and attentive without being over-the-top. As a veteran server, I realize how difficult this can be and her nuanced attentiveness deserves a tip-of-the-hat. In fact, both of the ladies on the floor that night were working in tandem, the energy was just right, and I was truly impressed. It's refreshing to see a newer spot have good food and amazing service. Looking forward to coming back for more of that killer tiramisu and ladies, keep crushing it. You're appreciated!!!"
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha H.","Not bad but wasn't anything special. I wouldn't recommend the Caesar salad, it was honestly one of my least favorite I've had in recent memory. Everything felt overpriced and then on top of that I was charged an extra $3 for ricotta on my pizza and it was just 3 small dollops. The crust was a little saltier than I prefer but the texture was great and the flavor of the toppings was wonderful. Overall, I didn't leave disappointed but probably won't be back."

"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sean T.","A solid Neapolitan pizza place that's become our staple on nights when we need something tasty, good for kids, and in our neighborhood (Greenwood). The place is small but rarely has a wait. There are 3 sections of the restaurant, a small part where you can view the pizza oven where all the action happens, a larger room where I have seen larger groups, and a back patio for when it's nice!
The menu has a revolving selection of cocktails and wines by the glass and bottle. The pizza menu is extensive and the apps/salad are legit. We typically get the meatballs, Caesar salad, margarita pizza, diavola, verde, and sometimes the Vongole (clams!). It's hard to go wrong.
The atmosphere is casual but as it gets later, it's a bit dim and the candles on the tables add a nice touch, so if you swing by after 8 it would be a good date place or if you come by later, say after 10pm, it would be nice for after a game or concert."
"Haymaker","https://www.yelp.com/biz/haymaker-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yang S.","I was meeting up with a friend there after work and wondering if we could make it to HH. If you are like me searching for HH information - it's daily 5-6pm then again 9-10pm at the bar area!
They have a decent HH menu with $2 oyster & $7ish wine. You could try some of their main dishes in a smaller portion from HH menu as well. My favorite was the pasta with beef cheek (not on HH menu), good for sharing btw two people.
This place is much more spacious than most restaurants in west Seattle. I'd consider it a good spot for small group events. Reservation is pretty easy through open table."

We choose a few dishes to share such as their crispy duck, rigatoni pasta, quail legs, and tuna appetizer. The duck and the pasta stood out to me. The duck was so moist with crispy skin. the pasta tasted fresh and was full of flavor.
The atmosphere was warm and inviting. It is a great place for an intimate dinner. The server was also very helpful and attentive."

"Haymaker","https://www.yelp.com/biz/haymaker-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dianna N.","My first time trying Haymaker was during Restaurant Week so I didn't see their regular menu. I did enjoy my meal and do want to make a return visit sometime!
Restaurant Week 3 course menu $35/person
Starters for the table
- I'm used to just picking your own starter, but here you get all 4 to share. What a great deal!
- Seared Tuna: I didn't try this because fish.
- Organic Greens: A pretty good salad. I wouldn't order it just because I rarely order salads at a restaurant, but I wouldn't complain if it was included as a side or starter.
- Risotto: Yummy and flavorful. I'd enjoy this as a full entree even.
- Pork Rillette: I had googled this beforehand to see if I wanted to choose it. I didn't think I'd like it because apparently it's similar to pate. But it was more like braised or pulled pork consistency, and salty. I ended up really liking it!
Choice of Entree
- Tonnarelli: This reminds me of cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) pasta. It was very creamy. I found it a little too peppery.
- Braised Beef Cheeks: They were out of duck confit, so this was the substitution. I only tried a small bite, but it was very tender.
Choice of Dessert
- Since there was 3 of us, we each ordered a different option so that we could try all 3.
- Chocolate Fritters: They are like chocolate donut holes. I don't care for chocolate cake or donuts that much (would rather have vanilla or another flavor), so I just thought these were OK. I did really like the dulce de leche sauce though.
- Sorbet: Blueberry was the only offered flavor, and I think you'll like it if you really like blueberry.
- Cheese: Baked Brie with a crouton. I love Brie so this was tasty! I like it gooey but since it hardens as it cools, it's like a challenge to eat it when it's still hot but not too hot.
Drinks
- Westside $12: I don't remember the taste now that it's been a couple days, but I liked it the most of the 3 drinks our table ordered.
- Green Light $13
- Improved Whiskey Cocktail $12
*****
My Star Ratings:
1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.
2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.
3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.
4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.
5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here."

We went on the second day after opening and it really seemed like they were very well prepared and knowledgeable of the menu.
We ordered the octopus, burrata, heirloom tomato, and Dungeness crab salad as appetizers. Our favorites were the burrata and octopus, but we all enjoyed the Dungeness salad as well. The heirloom salad was a bit of a disappointment compared to the rest.
For the pasta and protein portions we ordered the rabbit bolognese, agnolotti, black cod, and pork loin. As expected (given the chef's focus on pasta at his other restaurants) the pasta was delicious. We were split 50-50 for which of the protein dishes was better, but I was a big fan of the black cod.
Will be back again!"
"Haymaker","https://www.yelp.com/biz/haymaker-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Priya P.","I was really excited to visit Haymaker but shortly upon entering, I realized this place is not for me. The vibe felt a little bit off/unwelcoming.
I was able to get a table without a reservation which was nice - but quickly came for realize (at least for my first visit) you have to wait 5-10 minutes to get initial drink service. I was by myself at a table below the bar area at this point, waiting for my friend.
When the server did come to my table, she was off putting. Friendly words yet came across as somewhat rude and condescending.
When my friend arrived it took the server a while for her to come to the table and get his order. When she did, he didn't get the most positIve vibe either. He ordered the same drink as I and was disappointed by the value for the price.
The server came to ask if we wanted food and we held off for a moment, debating if we wanted to stay for another drink - and for food. When we decided to ask for the check, it was evident she was annoyed by us. We saw her walk back toward the kitchen and say something to her colleague whom seemed to smile about whatever she said. We are pretty certain she spoke negatively about us at this point when we didn't ever do or say anything to her to warrant it.
I was hoping I would love this place, but nope! Not based on the service today.
I will not return to Haymaker nor recommend it to any of my friends, or otherwise.
The $14 cocktails were good though - but better worth the spend somewhere else."

My dirty martini was among the best I've had, and the others liked their beer and cocktails. Our server was stellar, he was very knowledgeable and helpful.
My husband and I were split on the crab salad. It had an Italian fish sauce on it, and I thought it was too salty and overpowered the crab, but husband liked it. Our friends loved their brussels sprouts and cauliflower, as well as the pork chop and scallops. We LOVED our 1/2 duck! It was perfect and so tasty. The tonnarelli, however, was hard, not al dente. My husband ate it, as he was hungry. We should have sent it back. Good wine by the glass."

But that 1/2 roasted duck...wow. When I saw it was one the website menu, I really needed to get to Haymaker. I appreciate that they do not just serve the breast of the duck, and that I was able to enjoy a phenomenal entree that was excellent value, and most importantly was perfect in flavor. The meat was tender and juicy, and the skin was crisp and golden. My wife's Tonnarelli was also excellent. The salad was huge (perfect to split) and flavorful, and broccoli was also excellent.
We will be back!!!"
"Haymaker","https://www.yelp.com/biz/haymaker-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Prad R.","Positive:
The Dungeness Crab was delicious. Best dish of the night. The agnolotti was also very good.
Negative:
The fuses were not well balanced. They served half a squash with 2 table spoons of goat cheese. The dessert was fried balls of dough served with a miniature portion of dulce de leche. The agnolotti portion size was small and not enough for one person. The service was mediocre and so was the drink selection.
If I go back, it would be for the crab."

"Haymaker","https://www.yelp.com/biz/haymaker-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Andrew M.","Decent addition to the West Seattle restaurant scene. The vibe is good and the pasta is (unsurprisingly) delicious, but the rest of the menu misses the mark on execution. Notably:
- Carrots were overcooked, undersalted, and the sauce was both too oily and too thin
- ""Improved Whisky Cocktail"" was way too heavy on the absinthe
- Sous vide pork tenderloin toppings were not well balanced in proportion, and the pork was surprisingly tough for a supposed 5 hour cook.
On the plus side, the guanciale pasta was amazing - a really spectacular dish.
If I were betting, I'd wager this place improves over the coming months. That said, it's not where it needs to be for me to recommend it, at least right now."
"Haymaker","https://www.yelp.com/biz/haymaker-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cesca B.","Happy Hour
Staff: friendly and attentive.
Ambiance: love it! It has a very industrial feel but it's bright and open. It's a small restaurant but the design makes it look like it's a lot more spacious. I even found the bathroom well designed. Also love an open kitchen.
Price: HH prices are decent for the portion and quality of food.
Food: ordered the oysters, pasta and burger. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The pasta and burger were both good BUT waaaaaaay too salty. The beef from the burger was one of the best I've had in a while. It comes with cheese which may be why it was salty. In that case, there should be less salt in the beef. The pasta also came with delicious Parmesan (?) but again, so salty. Thinking about it, I should have sent them both back.
I'm on the fence of going back. There aren't a lot of places like this in West Seattle. I may ask friends if they experienced the same overly salty dish or if it was just a fluke that day."

That's a heck of a deal for a quality meal.
With the possible exception of the carrots we ordered, everything else we tried was excellent. Perfectly prepared and expertly presented. The pasta with mushrooms and sausage is to die for (all of their pastas are really good), the steak with frites was spot on, and the swordfish cooked to perfection.

As a long time fan of Raccolto, I was excited to see an expanded menu concept featured at Haymaker. We've been in twice now, and haven't been disappointed in any of the dishes we've tried (and we've tried a lot of them.)
Standouts include: the burrata (which we've had served with both peach and eggplant, the grilled broccoli with fonduta, and the roasted baby carrots. The proteins are definitely the stars of the show, and I will have a hard time not ordering the pork collar and the NY steak on future visits. Both dishes have so much flavor, and the meat is cooked absolutely perfectly. I am usually not a huge fan of fries with steak, but these are crispy, salty, and delicious.

"Holy Cannoli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/holy-cannoli-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christine L.","Review for cannolis only (but they did have coffee & sandwiches)!
I'm a little picky about how sweet desserts are and usually shy away from cannolis because they always feel like a mouthful of sugar, but these were just the right amount of sweet and crunchy! There's a menu of 5-6 different types and I scooped up the Original, Espresso, and Lemon. They're made to order, too, so the shells are fresh, the filling is a really lovely smooth consistency and (again) not overpoweringly sweet. The lemon was my fav hands down, and it wasn't a long wait for 3 large cannolis at all. Service was fast, efficient, and polite! Pricing is a little on the expensive side in my opinion but, hey, it's a solid cannoli!
I rate places or depending on if I'd return and Holy Cannoli is a for me. I'd totally go back for a quick sugar fix when the craving strikes!"
"Holy Cannoli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/holy-cannoli-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jacques I.","My friend and I came here for, you guessed it, cannolis! We visited in the late morning on a Saturday and all of the small shells for a cannoli were sold out. So, both of us ordered the original of the large, which they fill in store. The original is a vanilla cream-filled cannoli with chocolate chips on the ends.
The space is small, but luckily, my friend and I were the only patrons so found some bar stools by the window. My cannoli was good, and though I am not a cannoli expert by any means, visiting Holy Cannoli makes me wanna be one! The shell was stiff, but easy to bite into and the vanilla cream was solid, and I really liked that it was served at a chilled temperature. For next time though I definitely would want to do a small cannoli, as I thought the large size was so rich for just one person. I'd also like to try the other flavors, like the coconut or Nutella!
In addition to cannolis, Holy Cannoli has savory items like Italian sandwiches, salads and a full espresso bar. It's nice to know that for some casual Italian eats on the go, Holy Cannoli is there for ya."
"Holy Cannoli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/holy-cannoli-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Matt U.","We happened across this place after an afternoon at the science center. All 5 of us were approaching hangry and Yelp helped us discover a spot for cannolis and sandwiches!
It was a quick walk from the science center and basically marked the edge of Belltown (we walked to another spot in Belltown afterwards!). The shop seats maybe 15 and serves soups (when available), sandwich (when available), cannolis and caffeinated beverages!
The just nearly eeked out a four in my book, mostly because the sandwich our little guys had was so good - the seven mile special - it was a Seattle porcine party on crusty bread! Out turkey Sami was just so so- I think we were the last folks ordering sandwiches that night and we definitely got the vibe that our presence wasn't really required for our baristas evening to be complete. Not rude, but similar to a cat - not caring a lot either way.
We shared 3 Cannolis - chocolate, original and lemon. All were very good, though a bit expensive. I think 3 were something like $9, so not cheap but not so expensive that you had to eat at the crumbs.
By the time we were there, they were out of soup, a couple sandwiches, a few cannolis and some beverages. A bit weird but c'est la vie'. I imagine that 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon isn't totally prime time, but not having a number of items was a bit lame. Again, first world problems!
Well worth checking out if you're in the mood for some Italian insoires goodness!"

Upon entering, the owner was surprisingly rude and put her finger up at me and gave me a stern look because she was on the phone. If I wasn't desperate to try a cannoli, I would've walked out at that exact moment LOL. While she was on the phone, I was browsing the cannolis on display and discussing the different flavors with my friends. After she got off the phone she explained that she was bombarded all day so that's why she was a little frazzled and was instantly friendly so I overlooked everything that happened upon my arrival haha. I just ordered the original cannoli in the mini shell, tried it, and wasn't too amazed. It was pretty messy to eat because the shell just cracked in half when I bit into it. They have plenty of flavors to try so maybe pick up a few if you stop by!"

I had the pistachio , traditional , chocolate , and they were all perfect tasting . Never too sweet and balanced easily with a latte or espresso, also made In house .

They also sell sandwiches and salads that are decently priced, but nothing amazing.

I got two small cannolis, one lemon and one traditional. Lemon was just tart enough with a balancing sweetness that wasn't overpowering. The traditional was dusted with a cocoa powder mixture and had a satisfying cream flavor with the perfect level of sweet.
Adrienne (the owner) and Nick were super friendly and accommodating. Talked with them for a good 5-10 minutes after finishing up my cannolis just because. A delicious and great experience all around."

Saw this on the Yelp map and decided to give it a try since it was near our breakfast spot. Each cannoli is $3 which is a tad bit pricey but I am on vacation, so I don't mind.
I ordered 3 different cannoli: original, salted caramel pecan and banana cream pie. I asked the cashier if she had any recommendations and she said that they are all about the same, just different flavors. No difference in texture or anything.
My favorite would be the banana cream pie. It had a hint of banana flavor and it was not too sweet. The salted caramel pecan was a miss for me. It sounded promising but I didn't think it was that great. I feel like the outside shell was not that fresh for the cannoli since it was kind of stale.
Would love to give it a try again if I knew that they were freshly made. Then again, I am no cannoli expert so maybe the shells are not supposed to be that crispy."
"Holy Cannoli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/holy-cannoli-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Van D.","Holy Cannoli!!!! I just saw this relatively nearby when I was on google maps so I decided to walk here. I love Cannolis and I had some time to kill so cannolis felt like a brilliant idea. This quaint little shop is easy to find and it has a tight interior with a few small table tops. I believe the majority of the people here order to go.
Cannoli Prices:
- $3/each
- $16/half dozen
- $28/dozen
These cannolis are fresh baked daily and they are freshly stuffed throughout the day. Adrian, the owner, was telling me if she had any leftover from the night before, she would sell them in the morning for half price. That's awesome business ethics.
I decided on buying 3 cannolis and I had every intention on saving them for later, but they were so delicious I actually ate all three within minutes of buying them. Had I known sooner, I would have probably gotten then half dozen or dozen. Anyways, I had the nutella, almond toffee crunch and lemon. They were all delicious but my favorite among the three was probably the almond toffee crunch.
Holy Cannoli is definitely a gem that I would recommend if you are visiting the Seattle area. There Italian pastries can be found in many places, but it is rare that you can get baked and stuffed so fresh!"
"Holy Cannoli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/holy-cannoli-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Eric E.","This review is for the cannoli only. I'm from the east coast...where imo, anything cannoli will be better than anywhere on the west. I was proven wrong today. This spot right here...has some goood stuff that reminded me of back home. New York and Jersey are still my top picks though.
The crunch and breakoff texture is on point...right before that cool filling hits and lushly melts away with the rest of your bite. Banana Cream Pie, Almond, Tiramisu, Traditional, or whatever flavors that excite you...will satisfy without cloying from too much sweetness.
I feel like I'm a different man after having a cannoli here. You know...like I have just discovered why my girl friends go all wow on these things. I'm on the hunt for some more sweet eats now.
5 stars baby! Do ittt!!!"

I bought three which were $3 each. These cannolis are short and fat as I would describe them. I've been to Italy and really missed the italian cannolis so these definitely hit the spot! They didn't taste identical to the italian ones, but they were a nice treat! The shell was crispy and crunchy and there was a generous amount of filling in each cannoli! The shop is small and there was no wait when I went. The parking lot across the street also had a nice view of the space needle, which was cool. I would go here again to fulfill my sweet tooth craving!"

This is the perfect name for this place because their cannolis are out of this world! We came an hour before they were going to close, so when we were looking for what kind of cannolis to get, it was slim pickings. But the girl at the counter was so nice.. she said she would fill the other cannolis she had with whatever flavor we wanted! We ended getting 4 - 2 of the traditional and 2 of the coconut. There are 2 sizes, but we opted for the smaller one and it was just perfect! Not too sweet and it had a great crunch. My favorite was the traditional :)

The pizza is just super unexpected and I love the idea of cutting it with a pair of gold scissors! This is super fun to do during HH and coming here with friends after a long hard day!
This is also a great working lunch location for obvious reasons! You can come here and share a glass of bubbly for a promotion or good talk or even just come here to get out of the office to talk shop. It's great 1:1 area.
I wish I felt more like I was in the spheres though. Gotta be honest it doesn't really have the feel to it if you've ever been inside the spheres themselves
The prices are a bit higher for the amount of food. That's why I warn ya that it is tapas style!

Modernly decorated, cozy, friendly atmosphere.
Although I wasn't very hungry, they had a unique selection of food and beverages! Having a holiday cocktail, I tried the Parco Savello which was unique & refreshing. Also sampled the Hadrian's Villa which was good as well.
Again, not being very hungry, but the menu looked so good, I decided I had to try some of the food. The Mushroom pizza was delightful and surprisingly not too heavy.
Will definitely be back to try some more the next time I'm in town!"
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gregory M.","It was a rainy December Friday night in Seattle. Imagine that, so it was perfect.The Center of the city was empty and the inside parking was free and we had a 8:15 PM reservation.
WG is located on the ground floor of one of the Amazon Spheres and as such it is a stunning minimalist space that curves around the inside. Our wet coats were taken and our party of 5 was quickly seated.
We began our evening with cocktails and appetizers that were both tasty and a bit pricy even for city center dining.
Cacio w Collins Honey crostini came with two small slices of the cheese and maybe a tablespoon of honey at $12.00.
Pacific octopus w/ roasted fennel and anchovy came with a price tag of $20.00. Both of these appetizers were very tasty but they both deserved either a larger portion or a more reasonable price.
The roasted beets w/ creme fraiche and the Gnocchi w/ pecorino both were very tasty and priced more in line for what we expected.
Now for the real reason to come to WG and that was the main course, Pizza. One large Chanterelle Pizza and one crispy Pepperoni Pizza were everything you would expect from a top notch Pizza kitchen and the Pepperoni was cooked to a prefect crispy crunch. These thick pies are served on wood cutting boards and you are given a pair of scissors to cut whatever size piece of pie yours eyes desire.
Overall the service was friendly and attentive the space is unique and visually exciting. The food was all very tasty. My recommendation would be to come for the Pizza which is very good and pass on the pricey appetizers. In fact that is what we will do next time we are in Seattle."

Long story short this place would get 5 stars if it didn't actually have the ghost of some dead guy named Pepper Willmott flying around! It was cool for like 10 minutes but then our pizza came and this ghost flew through it like 8 times and made it smell like farts! Who wants a haunted fart pizza?! 2 stars for getting a ghost to haunt your establishment, 1 Star for the bartender knowing what a Shirley Hemple was (from the show What's Happening) and 1 Star for square shaped pizza, even though ours got haunted which ruined Goth practice for my group."
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sheena L.","This is in one of the Amazon spheres, but you can't really see the plants or garden part at all. Came here for a quick pre-dinner drink / snack. Ambiance is very clean, bright, a bit feminine, but really pleasant.
I think they're known for their pizzas but we got the fried gnocchi, burrata and focaccia. Didn't expect the gnocchi to be fried when we ordered, but it is on the menu as ""fritti"" so we just didn't notice. Regardless, it was pretty delicious, somewhere in between a smooth tater tot and croquette, and it had a nice mild heat. I enjoyed them. The burrata was ok, but I thought it was a really small portion. I'm used to it being served in a ball and this was like a half a ball that was cut open. It was really too small for $15, presentation wasn't super appetizing, and it didn't even come with any bread, the focaccia was a separate order. I will say the focaccia was really good though and I'm glad we ordered it.
I also got the Minerva's cup cocktail and enjoyed it. If you like mezcal I thought it was refreshing and good for summer.
I give it 3.5 stars, but because I didn't get pizza It might be unfair rate this restaurant as a whole. I rounded up to 4 for decent food and fun ambiance, and giving benefit of doubt for the pizza."
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","Beautiful space with a fresh and exquisite menu. Located on the exterior of the Amazon Spheres, Willmott's Ghost is a great little spot to get the true Seattle/Amazon experience.
We went for a mid-week lunch, and as soon as you walk in you are floored by the tastefully designed space. The decor lends to a feminine feel that is light and airy, which complements the next-door Spheres well. I couldn't stop gushing over the pink with gold accents everywhere, lending way to a gorgeous bathroom and Instagram-worthy experience.
We sat outside, which is great people/dog watching as the restaurant is right next to the Amazon Day 1 building. Once you get past the gorgeous design, you can focus in on the menu which is carefully curated and focused on fresh ingredients.
GET THE PIZZA! I got the zucchini pizza with mint, mozzarella, almond and feta, as well as the side of figs with ricotta and focaccia. The slice of pizza came out, and they're cut square and are a little different than pizza you may be used to but the bread is to die for -- it's light and fluffy, and definitely full of flavor. Topped with the toppings of your choice, it's something I can't wait to order again. Really not sure how the pizza was so good to a pizza snob like me, but it was incredible.
The figs were a small portion - but a nice little side. The ricotta it was served with was soft and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the figs. I recommend ordering a few of these 'sides' and going with a big pizza or two (you can order whole pizzas vs. just a slice) if you have a large enough group.
If you're looking for a pretty restaurant with amazing food, Willmott's Ghost is a great find in the hustle and bustle of the Amazon campus. I'm looking forward to round 2!"

The decor is very 1950s diner. Small place, very cute. Seems out of place to be in the Amazon Spheres, but it is very cool inside.
The drinks were fun and smart. The Panna Oro was a creamsicle turned into a drink. It wasn't crazy sweet like at other restorative have tried to mimic a creamsicle. It was perfectly balanced and tasted just like a creamsicle. LOVED IT!!!!!
The food was great too. We definitely ordered way too much food, but it was all good and we got to take home leftovers. We had their Fresh & Pickled Pepper Pizza. It could've used some sausage on it to round out all the flavors, but still very good. The Scallop Crudo was great. The pickled cherries that came with the Pork Terrine was amazing. We also had their Brick Chicken with Chicken Liver Pate.

The place is gorgeous! Obviously! Open kitchen! Open sphere! Love! Came with my girlfriends for a week night dinner and we shut it down! Literally!
The good/ decor and service!
A ok: the food!
Six of us ordered everything on the menu for primi and appetizers (6-8?) .Got a secondi and a pizza and a few desserts!
Most dishes are good. Having an Italian family means my expectations are a little higher. And having family in Rome and spending a month there every year, I'm all about Roman food!
So some of the dishes are good. Just a little too busy! Mortadella is what we usually make at home. It's great. But the pizza has the spice that you usually don't find in Italian food/ Roman cuisines.
The calamari was too oily. They were good but not great. Nothing really stands out. Also we did a lot of fried items. Got so full so fast! Clams were good but not quite Roman. Too much seasoning. Pizza was the same. Overall, we had a blast from the company and the atmosphere. We left full too. Food was a ok for me! The staffs great though!"
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kelsey B.","Willmott's Ghost is a great concept, in reality however it misses the mark. My brother and I looked to make a reservation here and it was wide open, so we chose to risk it for a table without a reservation on a Sunday night. We showed up and the place was empty except for two tables. They asked if we had a reservation which we said no, and they were only able to seat us at the bar. We looked around at the entire restaurant with open tables but they refused to let us take a table.
We ordered salad, burrata, drinks, and a pizza to share. The salad was delicious and had a great dressing. The bartender failed to tell us that the burrata did not come with bread until after it arrived, so we had to order focaccia at that point which they bake from scratch so it took another 20 minutes to arrive. It was worth the wait because it was delicious, but it seemed like something they would want to mention at the time a customer orders the burrata.
The pizza was good, it was unique that you had to cut your own piece but it was fun at the same time.
By the time we were done with our two hour meal, there were multiple tables that were still available and we could have sat at. Not allowing us to sit at a table felt like a strange choice since the restaurant was empty the entire night.
The atmosphere was pretty, and very aesthetically pleasing. I would probably go back to see if the service changed at all, but it seemed like a mismatch from the image they are presenting."

It was on sourdough bread, had tons of pepperoni, and was huge! The aperol spritz was also really good.

Loved the olive oil that soaked the food. I tried their highly recommended sausage pizza and it is on a thick bready crust. Seemed a bit on the too salty side for me even though I can eat a bag of cornnuts in one sitting. It is very cheesy though with a few pieces of sausage on it. The potato garlic scapes pizza was also salty and on a breast crust. I could only eat the potato which was the least salty of the pizza."
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Trang P.","This place is decent. Aside from their cool location (inside of the Amazon Sphere), their menu wasn't super expansive and their HH is just okay. HH was 1/2 off on 4 appetizers and $15 for the pepperoni pizza. It's also a bit more on the pricey side and for the food they served - it wasn't entirely worth it.
Not to mention, our waiter wasn't very attentive. We had to ask him for a refill on water and crostini a couple of times before he remembered. He also forgot to ring in the focaccia bread so when we got our burrata, we didn't get a chance to eat it with the bread. He also cleared our calamari without asking if we were done with it and did not pick up our dirty plates. The host was much friendlier and attentive IMO.
Also note there is a 20% gratuity charge and the gratuity charge is added to the total... so they TAX you more off your total bill. I have never experienced the gratuity charge being a part of the total at any other establishment.. so this was indeed strange. Personally - I would have not mind paying the 20% gratuity if A) service was better B) the food was better.
My friends and I ordered a wide selection of food - focaccia, burrata, chicken liver pate, gnocchi fritti, calamari, scallop crudo, penn cove mussels, Salish Sea halibut, the Lumni Island flash fried shrimp, and the pepperoni pizza.
What I liked:
Pepperoni pizza, focaccia, burrata (although nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary), squid, scallop crudo, and the Salish Sea halibut.
Everything else was just sub par. The gnocchi in particular was a complete waste of money. It was just overly salty, lacked flavor and was dumped in Parmesan.
Most likely will not be making a return."
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek B.","I'm giving this 5 stars because of the pepperoni pizza + decor. It's in the Spheres so that's a thing. The decor is magazine-worthy, and you can get some good IG moments here. You can make reservations on OpenTable, so that's convenient. So yeah. That's enough for 5 stars.
The people who work here are, like, *cool*. But to the guy's credit, we asked for wine recommendations to pair with the pizza, and he was knowledgable about their wines and gave a great recommendation.
We ordered burrata and focaccia to start. After a few moments the guy came back saying that they were out of burrata. We got there right when they opened. So that was whatever. We still got the focaccia and it was good. And with the burrata, I'm pretty sure it would have been amazing.
The pizza was perfection. I think it's called Sicilian style? The pepperoni was on point. So so good. They serve it traditionally where it isn't cut. And they give you scissors to cut it. So if you're trying to look cute on a date or something, be prepared to deal with that.
We ordered the pistachio ice cream with biscotti even though we were pretty full, and it was definitely not a mistake.
I'll definitely be back."

Like all of Renee Erickson's restaurants, there is always a particular color that gives off an aura of sophistication, yet is inviting. Here at Willmott's Ghost, it's rose-petal pink. Pink espresso machine, pink cocktails, pink flowers and gold accents all around. I dug it.
For cocktails my friend ordered The Rose Society while I went with Mr. Pink. We had seats right at the bar where the bartender was making all the magic, and most of the cocktails she made were pink, including the spritzer that was on happy hour. We also shared the fried gnocchi, which is one of the food items on happy hour. My Mr. Pink cocktail was nice, especially because I could taste the rhubarb-infused Campari, which is primarily why I ordered it. I love the sour flavor of rhubarb, which you definitely get from this drink. Since I don't like sweet drinks either, I was especially happy that this one was more on the sour side; and I say sour in a good way. The fried gnocchi was yummy! Texture of the gnocchi was perfect with a light crunchy batter, but soft in the middle from the pasta. I really liked that it was made with chilis, so had a spicy bite to it, not needing any kind of dip or sauce to go with. I'd recommend it. Menu is Italian-themed.
Though the A-frame sign outside of Willmott's Ghost reads that happy hour is from 4-6pm, it's actually 3-5pm. We were bummed to learn that our happy hour window when we arrived was cut shorter, but glad I know for next time. It is cool to visit Willmott's Ghost since it's in the spheres, as the windows are exactly that. I'd check it out, at least once...over a pink cocktail."
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lady S.","I3 stars for cute atmosphere. Horrible service. Went and four tables were there and plenty of staff. Took forever to get glass of wine and at least 25 mins between our apps and main course. Never came by to check in is in between or voice updates. Food was mediocre and overpriced. Maybe a good spot to grab a drink at the cute bar but that's the most I'll go back for."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Robert U.","The place is beautifully decorated. Lovely restaurant with great food, service, atmosphere. Varied Italian starters. I had Canneloni alla Fiorentina (ground veal) and my partner had the Spaghetti Carbonara.
The staff was very attentive and the owner checked in on us a few times during the evening to see how we were doing, this on a busy Sunday. The tiramisu dessert was delicious and authentic.
Definitely a repeat visit. The coffee following superb. The service was very good too."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Case H.","Zio Sal is the nice higher-end Italian restaurant that REDMOND desperately needs and deserves. What it does well:
Anything sausage or pork or pesto related.
The atmosphere and decor are excellent.
The bar and wine list is fully stocked and great.
Where do they need to improve?
The chefs need to get on the same page for the pasta dishes.
The pizza needs to be removed from the menu altogether or have a page one Re-write.
They need another server OR two people whose only job is to bring out the food. The staff is simply stretched too thin.
The aroncini rice balls should be smaller so that there can be four at the table.
There needs to be a larger amount of bread at the table.
A simple kids menu is critical; we're a family suburb.
I know this seems like a lot, but this restaurant has the potential to be Carmine levels of great! It's a fantastic date place, it's walkable, and reasonably priced. As-is -it's still good, but it can become great. The restaurant is only 10 days old; therefore, it has time to become perfect.
Should you go? YES! This restaurant could become a true Redmond Gem. This is really critical because we have no Italian food for miles around!"
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Kelly W.","Wow! The food is outstanding! I enjoyed every dish, every flavor. They are working out the kinks in being recently opened but don't let that stop you.
The staff is attentive. Water was refilled, plates were cleared, extra food was boxed without a glitch. The marinara is heaven! Beautiful notes of bright tomato with delicate seasoning, sausage that is robust and satisfying. The wine list is a beautiful representation of many regions of Italy.
It can be a bit loud but that is not so bad. I told my server how much I enjoyed the tastes and the chef was brought to my table. It was an honor to thank him for a lovely meal."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","LB C.","So excited to have authentic Italian food in Redmond!!!!!
From the atmosphere to the food to tHe people you will enjoy every aspect of eating here!!!!! Bring Family, Friends and Business here to enjoy the service and food!!!!"
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Henry F.","Looks like this place just opened... and wow! This is what Redmond needed. The atmosphere when you walk in is calm, inviting, and modern. Menu has fantastic choices and honestly wish I could try everything. Specials were written on a large chalkboard above the kitchen so definitely give that a look.
We picked up an order of calamari, manicotti, and a slice of pizza to share between the two of us. Food came out fast but in fairness it was relatively slow at the moment inside. First up, the calamari is perfect. A large serving of crispy calamari with an awesome sauce on the side. It can be difficult to find something comparable in Redmond so if you like calamari definitely give this a try.
The manicotti was the star dish though. Two tubes stuffed to the brim with a perfect ricotta mixture filling it. The sauce was better than anything I've had in the area with everything perfectly cooked. Compared to nearby Tropea who burned their manicotti that I had to scrape off the plate, Sal's was heavenly. I can't wait to try more pastas.
The pizza was pretty good but definitely paled in comparison to the other two dishes. Perfectly fine since it seems to be more of a side menu item or perhaps for the bar being priced effectively. I'm just a pizza dork and had to get it.
Dessert we tried their cannoli and this was impressive! My girlfriend loves cannoli and even makes them at home. Hers are good but these are great. I generally don't like cannoli but could easily down this.
Top it all off with great and friendly people and you've got a fantastic resteraunt.
Small side note, I don't understand that one negative review in regards to portion size. We didnt order too much and were struggling to finish it all despite being so good. If somebody wants to stuff their face, feel free to buy some big box fast food crap if you want. Here, you'll get a quality and hearty meal for a fair price. We can't wait to go back."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer G.","We stopped by due to a recommendation from someone in the business and were not disappointed. We had the ravioli and Bolognese and it was delicious. Great prices. Perfectly cooked pasta. The wine list is good and with prices that will entice you to have more than one glass. We shared a tiramisu and it was excellent. Not too much coffee or a soggy cookie. So good. You've got to go and experience it for yourself."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Chris J.","I've been going to Seattle for business for quite a while now, and every trip i take I make sure to eat Italian. I've been to numerous spots trying to find my favorite. My hunt stopped tonight. I absolutely loved the food! The fulissi and lemon cheesecake were amazing! I recommend everyone eat here if you're looking for some authentic Italian.
Great service as well! Never had to ask for a refill."

"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Nora B.","I have been here twice, and there are some great things about this place. The servers are nice but they're stretched too thin. The pesto was great, but the tortellini with cream sauce was nothing special. The pizza is not good. It's focaccia with marinara sauce and not nearly enough cheese. Totally out of place on the menu. And it was cold. The aroncini (sp) came with just one ball to split between the 4 of us. The free focaccia was also meager. The pork chop with Marsala sauce was amazing. I'll go back, for sure, but they have some tweaking to do."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Christopher S.","Stopped by on a quiet Sunday evening and enjoyed a quality meal. Great selection of wine, too (tried the Chianti Classico Riserva). Focaccia bread was made in-house and delicious. Green salad with salami and provolone was well dressed, followed by spaghetti bolognese. Food is really well prepared and they clearly use high quality ingredients. Definitely recommend!"

We are open for just a week and you ordered something out of the menu - yes my people made a mistake not adding the chicken but you could easily ask again. Any new restaurant may have some issues at the very beginning and thank god most people understand and give a chance plus support at any new activity.
Yes I agree at Maggiano you bet much more food for the same money.... If eating it's about quantity Maggiano is the place to go.
I want wish a fabulous weekend to everybody and please come to celebrate with us if you have a chance.
God bless you all!!!

This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to on the west coast! I was visiting a friend in Seattle and we decided to stop by as it was a nearly opened spot and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere aside from the food is a reason to stop in. The food is some of the best looking and delightfully tasting I've had in some time! Val who I believe is a server/manager was so amazing she made the experience worth while! If you ever find yourself in Redmond, WA definitely give this place a go. Prices are great, service is even better, trust me you won't be disappointed!"

Been here three times in the first couple weeks. It's nice not having to drive to Bellevue for great cozy Italian. Love the three tv screens too!
Have enjoyed a spectacular Marsala Pork Chop with Aglio e Olio - spaghetti carbonara! - pizza and lasagne over my three visits.
Everyone also very pleasant - especially manager Valentina who has greeted us on each visit.
We'll definitely be back soon!"

Valentina was wonderful and explained the story of the restaurant. Her father Salvatore moved here from Italy and opened their first restaurant ""Firenze"". They get fresh food flown in from Italy, so it is REALLY authentic italian cuisine. I will absolutely be back, what a wonderful experience."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Danielle L.","What a fantastic Friday night experience! My husband and I stumbled upon a new Italian restaurant, Zia Sal at RTC in Redmond. They just opened 2 weeks ago. We shared a fantastic evening together thanks to our fantastic server Lea; since place is new we followed her recommendations and tried two of the specials. They both had very romantic Italian names that I can't remember, but my husbands was a ribeye with mushrooms, potatoes and vegetables, mine was chicken piccata style, and we shared a spaghetti with saffron and lobster tails. For dessert we had pisashio cheesecake; it was so delicious! I highly recommend this new place in Redmond. We really needed another choice besides our regular standbys RGB and Prime."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle S.","I came here with no expectations. The wine pours were small (maybe too big of a wine glass). I ordered one dish, but something else came out. The waitress was confused but accommodating. It took a few minutes and my family was eating their main meal. Once she brought it, I could not eat it. It was fusilli with Marinara sauce and the pasta was completely overcooked. Not at all al dente. I sent it back. I'm Italian, lived in Italy and traveled extensively. I could not eat overcooked pasta. Perhaps it's opening kinks. I don't think I can go back. It was unforgivable."
"Zio Sal","https://www.yelp.com/biz/zio-sal-redmond?osq=Italian+Food","Todd Y.","We ate dinner at Zio Sal on Saturday night, and at 5:30 it wasn't too crowded yet. We were seated right away, and the server was very friendly and efficient. I had the Pollo Ripieno, my wife had the Pollo A Tuo Placere with limone sauce, and my son had the Spaghetti Bolognese. All were excellent and a very well priced. I also ordered a cup of Minestrone and a hazy IPA, which were also excellent. The only things that could be improved were the food took quite a while to be served, and the spaghetti portion was a little small, perhaps a larger option should also be offered. Overall, Zio Sal is a very welcome addition to the limited offerings of quality Italian food on the eastside. We plan to return often."

"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sina R.","Excellent food! Try their fried dates. They are really good.
You can feel all the spices there and how the chef balanced them perfectly.
I don't give 5 starts because our table was not somehow spacious. A little bit tiny in the middle of others."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Terri T.","Entrance was a bit odd because there was outdoor seating near the stairs, but you'd have to walk past the tables to enter the restaurant. Staff was friendly and food was good!
FALAFEL SALAD $18 (5/5): highly recommend this dish! Super flavorful and everything in it tied well together.
CICCHETTI (4/5): we ordered the 3 for $16, and the 3 we ordered were the dates, beef tartare and pomegranate muhamma. The pomegranate is like a sweeter hummus and comes with flatbread. Beef tartare was ok; I didn't think it was super flavorful or anything special. The dates were super good; filled with chorizo, a great mix of savory and sweet. I would recommend the Cicchetti to share!
Sharing the falafel salad and Cicchetti was enough for two. I would recommend this place!"
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth L.","Our Eastlake go-to for delicious small plates, excellent cocktails, awesome late-night menu.
The cicchetti (small plates) are super tasty and addicting - have frequently enjoyed and highly recommend:
Wood-fired halloumi and olives - SO GOOD
Pomegranate muhammara - flavorful
Beef tartare - a lovely treat
Hummus, grilled pita - simple perfection
Smoked mussel escabèche - wonderfully smoked flavor, not overdone
Confit chicken wings and their flatbreads fresh out of the wood-fired oven are also quite tasty.
Lovely ambiance - great for date night or small groups. The staff here keep us coming back - bartender Tyler makes delicious cocktails with your spirit of choice, large cocktail list to enjoy. Jerry has been our server on numerous occasions and always makes us feel at home.
Daily happy hour runs Tuesday-Saturday 5-6:30pm, featuring large plates for $9-$12 including pizzas, kefta burger, wings, falafel, as well as a Cicchetti trio for $14. Drink specials include house wines (red, white, cava) for $6, drafts $2 off, wells $5.50, house cocktails $7.50."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Scott G.","Best date night venue in Seattle. Ha ha. I don't even like dates but their date small plate is awesome. What are dates anyway, a big raisin or small prune? LOL
We sat at the bar for Happy Hour and had almost everything on HH menu and everything was fabulous. Would have rated it a 5 star but the small plates are really small and pricey for what you get. Check it out."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marc L.","Was pleasantly surprised at how awesome the food and space was! Tucked away in a quiet corner of Eastlake, this place has a ton of interesting menu offerings and a cozy interior.
My buddy and I tried some of Cicchetti apps, including the brussels, dolmas, and muhumarra. These were all fantastic, particularly the maple yogurt that adorned the sprouts.
For our mains we shared the brick chicken and the falafel. The chicken skin was beautifully crisp and perfectly cooked throughout. The charred leeks and potatoes bravas side dishes were also quite tasty. The falafel were good, but have had better elsewhere in the city.
Our server was great as well. Will be back, hopefully with a date."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jackie N.","Such a cute little place with outdoor seating and the inside is great as well. We sat inside and it wasn't that crowded so we had our own little room off to the side which was nice. Got the toscana red wine as well, where a bottle was nice to split for the entire meal. The trio of small plates was so good and although it doesn't look like a lot it's pretty filling. The dates were my favorite and would totally get them next time as well and try new things for the other two choices if I'm feeling adventurous. There's something for everyone on the menu and although a little pricey, the food and ambiance was completely worth it!"

I definitely see myself coming back."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia L.","A lovely little place. The restaurant is pretty small with limited seating. It's situated inside what appears to be a converted residential house. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The ambiance was casual yet mature. The lighting was very dim with various interesting light fixture designs. I recommend sticking to the cicchetti portion of the menu & their drinks (especially wine) menu. Everything I tried from cicchetti menu was flavorful, fresh, and delicious in their own way. The entree was mediocre. I had a daily special: tagliolini with pork cheeks. The spices/flavors were not to my taste - strong peppercorn taste and not very complementary cashew bits. Some of the tagliolini was clumped & hardened together at the ends. I would be willing to give this place another try though for the cicchetti and drinks only next time."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ghyrn W.","Alex was our server, and he made the experience great for us. He was very knowledgeable about the food - he was well-acquainted with every ingredient and answered all our questions. He described the dishes accurately and we liked our food. It was Seattle Restaurant Week, and we went with the special 3-course dinner. We also added a ""Cicchetti"", I.e. small plate appetizer. This was a great value financially,
The food was presented well. My wife had the fattoush salad. I started with the cod tamasalata - these dish names are from memory & I know I'm not getting them correct. My wife loved the crispy Brussels sprouts. I loved the prawn skewers with polenta and asparagus. My wife enjoyed her spaghetti genovese. Delicious chocolate semifreddo & I had strawberry rhubarb mousse & enjoyed it.
Found a parking space close by in the street. Loved the ambience. Kind of a vintage feel."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kay N.","My boyfriend and I stumbled on this restaurant because we wanted to eat some Greek/Mediterranean food. Who knew this great restaurant is tucked behind the popular Italian restaurant, Serafina?
The restaurant does have a front patio which I can see being very popular in Summer. They have happy hour Tuesday - Saturday. We ordered various of dishes such as their pizza of the day,Cicchetti Trio, and their dish of the day. We really enjoyed every dish. It was executed well as everything was pretty flavorful, and tasted fresh.
I also thought the service was superb. The server checked up on us a few times and there was another server that made sure our waters were full and took away dishes when we were done. Everyone was pretty friendly as well.
This place is a great for a date night or intimate dinner with friends/family."
"Cicchetti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cicchetti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ran D.","This place is awesome!
Three of us went to this place last night during Seattle Restaurant Week. We picked the restaurant because the menu looks really good and it's really close by.
The entrance is a bit hidden. It's not directly on Eastlake, it's behind the next door restaurant on a side street. But once you found the sign everything was smooth.
We were seated at a table beside the window on the second floor ( you will need to climb a few stairs). We ordered all three options of the appetizers and the desserts, and for entree we all picked lamb shoulder. The result was wonderful! The overall taste was excellent, especially the lamb shoulder and one of the desserts we had (see picture). It's a cracker with artisanal Brie cheese and house jam. It sounds generic but it's so good! So good that we had to order one extra lol
We didn't pay attention to the regular price of meh items, but we think for $35 the food we had was totally worth it. Worth to mention they do automatically add a 3% subcharge for the back kitchen staff. No tips were added automatically."

This cute little place packs in a lot of tables and people without feeling too crowded. And the ambiance is unassuming, intimate, and perfect for a date night or a meet up with friends. The menu triggers all my good memories of small Mediterranean small plates during my travels. We ordered a starter plate off the main menu: wood fire roasted dates stuffed with chorizo in a pimiento aioli, but then went for the SRW menu after that. For me: fattoush with gem lettuce, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, and tahini yogurt dressing; rosemary prawn skewers with creamy polenta, black garlic aioli, charred asparagus, and romesco (one of my favorite SRW dishes); and for dessert artisanal brie, berry compote, and poppy seed lavosh. Hubby had the smoked cod taramasalata with charred scallion, lemon oil, Aleppo, and crisp pita; spaghetti Genovese with arugula-walnut pesto, spring onion, green bean and pecorino; and for dessert chocolate semifreddo, salted caramel, peanut butter, peanut cookie, and candied peanuts.

Still, for how small the menu is, it certainly covers a wide variety of foods on based on the Mediterranean style. Like I said, we'll be back."

Well by finally I mean they have been here for a while but it took forever for me to check it out haha. The cicchetti dishes are all amazing sounding and quite tasty. I very much enjoyed the muhammara. Only complaint is it comes with just a few pita chips and if you want more they will charge for these (oh and they won't tell you this... you just find it on your bill later... just a little surprise for you haha). The falafels are to die for. Perfectly cooked with a crispy exterior and soft center and the feta yogurt and cucumbers they are served with in phenomenal. They also do an excellent lamb dish. They have a nice patio area outside which is lovely on a warm day."

It's our favorite restaurant on the north side of Seattle. The decor is okay enough, nothing too special, the lighting is a bit bright (like I wish they had candles on the tables) but my goodness, the food. It's sooo good.
Also, I love that it's a family-owned place. It's Greek and the family is Greek. An ethnic restaurant run by ethnic people (unless it's Mexican) isn't very common in upscale, vanilla Seattle. If you're lucky, you'll run into the grandma on Saturday nights serving tables. She's the sweetest. The whole family is. There have been times I've asked for a particular pasta with particular veggies and they make whatever I want.
We have three kids and they can accommodate a large family like ours and thank God, it's one of the few reasonably priced places in Seattle. It's not cheap but it's not overpriced. Because it's not overpriced, we go there probably every two weeks.
A lovely little restaurant run by a lovely family."

"Santorini Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/santorini-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Emily C.","Came across this place with some extended family in the area. I was just expecting a typical Americanized Italian restaurant but was pleasantly surprised with not only the cuisine but the service! We were seated right away, our drinks and food came promptly as well. I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and it was delightful! Usually Alfredo can be too heavy for my taste at restaurants but this had the perfect consistency- not too heavy and tons of flavor. Our waiter talked to us a lot about the wine we ordered as well as Greece where he is from. He even came over to top our glasses of wine off in the middle of our meal! Definitely a wonderful touch that made us feel welcome. I will for sure be coming back!"

The price is very reasonable for you get. I really enjoyed their lasagna, chicken alfredo, and the spinach ravioli. The Santorini Pizza was pretty good too;filling, I was done after 2 slices. They went the extra mile to help celebrate my girlfriend's birthday with their homemade tiramisu cake (ice cream tiramisu). I definitely will be back with my family!"
"Santorini Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/santorini-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cat S.","I'm a little unsure about why this place is rated so highly. I came for dinner about a week ago and it was basic and mediocre. I ordered pasta because it looked like that's what the whole restaurant was ordering, so I figured it must be good. I ended up with mushy overcooked pasta and overcooked shrimp. The pesto sauce wasn't special either. It's possible that it might have come from a jar?
They were very busy so perhaps the kitchen was slammed and that's why the food wasn't cooked properly? Perhaps this is also the reason why service wasn't great. It took a long time for anyone to approach us at the table, and when they finally did it was very ""what are you getting?"" instead of ""Hi, welcome, have you dined with us before?"" The rest of dinner was the same short cold service. It felt like they just wanted us gone to open the table for someone else.
I'm quite disappointed because I had such high hopes. It always seems packed with people and the Yelp ratings were so high that I thought it would be fantastic, except it wasn't. Nothing special about this place."

The first few times we dined in. But as others have mentioned it's a small establishment, so now we always call in an order to go. While they have remodeled since we first came, the ambiance holds me back from giving it 5 stars.
We love to get their tortellini with pesto cream sauce & chicken and the pasta with broccoli, sun dried tomatoes & clams. Hylopetes I think is the name. Their pizzas are also to die for!!!
Love that it's a family run business. :)"
"Santorini Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/santorini-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alishea T.","Please don't pass this place up! The interior does not speak to the food. I promise.
I'd happily come here just for the tiramisu! But everything I've had so far is amazing.
The owner loves to stop and chat, and is very knowledgeable about what's going on in the kitchen (that's not actually that common)! You can tell there is great pride in what they prepare and serve, and all is house made, including their insane-o house vinaigrette.
Now about that tiramisu: also house made, and they do something I think is kind of amazing, but maybe it's just me; they freeze it, but because of the liquor it only soft freezes, so when they serve it to you, it's this cold, creamy, boozy, delicious slice of heaven. They aren't freezing it for storage folks, they're freezing it so that this amazing thing happens to it and you become addicted and keep coming back for more.
I guess I should discuss the pastas too?
Delish. Perfectly sauced, al dente, not bogged down in garlic, which is a nice change of pace. There's not a whole lot worse than having to take a handful of Tums after eating Italian because it's like you ate a whole bulb of garlic.
Please, please try this place. I promise you won't regret it."

He wasn't lying. The service was really fast and friendly. The food was taste bud happy. I got a antipasto salad (yummy), gnocchi (phenomenal), cheese pizza (homey), and my partner got fettuccine alfredo. Let's talk about the gnocci, oh em gee it was to die for. The gnocci was perfectly tossed in this roma sauce with tender spinach and spicy sausage. Mmm it was so good I didn't even want to stop.

The toppings were good as well, little one had the cheese pizza and I got their santorini which had some awesome tasty sausage balls which were flavorful and lots of fennel seeds! The sauce was light and not too heavy it was a nice combination with the fresh tomatoes on top! It was great for a last minute causal stop!"
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Liz S.","Arrived around 7 on a Tuesday and the place was full! Thankfully a high top table was available in the bar so I snagged that ASAP.
For drinks I went with their special grapefruit? Negroni ($12). It was lighter than a regular Negroni and pretty good. It was served in a lowball... up? I don't remember honestly it could have had ice ha. I had a sip of their regular Negroni ($11) as well--gin, Campari, vermouth--and was glad I went with the special. Well I had two of them and yes they're strong so drink your water and eat ha.
Now there aren't a lot of healthy/meatless options (especially plant-based) but thankfully the Barbabietola salad was sounding good. The salad is comprised of lots of fresh arugula, braised beets, fennel, goat cheese, and basil pesto dressing ($8/$12). I received a pile of lightly tossed arugula (yay for not dumping on the dressing) along with a handful of cubed red beets, fennel shavings, and a smattering of crumbled goat cheese. I had requested that the cheese be left off but they must have overlooked that note. Oh well, I'm not allergic so it didn't matter too much... cheese is tasty I just try to limit my intake. I somehow managed to refrain from chowing down on the bread that came out before dinner but I did polish off my salad.
The atmosphere is pleasant. Casual but not toooo casual. Service was decent, no real complaints.
It would be nice if they had another veggie option, maybe something without a ton of dairy but my experience was enjoyable enough."

Drinks: I had wine, which was recommended by the server and was a perfect accompaniment to the food. My friend had a cocktail and then wine, which he said was also paired well.
Food: I had the butternut squash ravioli, which was absolutely delicious. The portion size was just right for me and it was fantastic. My friend had one of the pizzas (pepperoni) and a side of crispy brussel sprouts, which he said was really good.

Away from the sleepy Main Street (which sadly gets more and more sleepy every time I'm there), Amaro is on the ground floor of one of the newly built condo/mixed use type of buildings very near Main Street. Parking appears to be street only, which is plentiful.
All of us opted to focus on the Pasta section of the menu, and we are all quite happy with our selection.
Best in class dish:
Ravioli di Zucca - Ravioli with butternut squash filling, covered in marsala cream sauce, generous amount of roasted mushrooms, and topped with arugula. The only thing wrong? I want more sauce. :)
I need to return and try their pizza next. I saw quite a few ordering from the brunch menu (admittedly, it's brunch time), so that's probably a future try too."

I recently visited for restaurant week for the prefix 3 course meal. But of course, we needed to start with wine.
I was really impressed with their wine list. They have a section where you can order a glass, half bottle or bottle which is always helpful when you have a bigger group or different drinkers! They also have a really fun coravin selection with impressive local and foreign wines.
For my dinner I went with the brussel sprouts, the Orecchiette (pasta with peas and ham in a cream sauce) and the tiramisu and it was all delish!! The tiramisu is from 'IL Bistro' their sister restaurant in Pike Place.
Our server was very informative and attentive and you could tell he was proud to work at Amaro. I'll be back!!

They have a nice happy hour menu with a bunch of options to choose from. The ravioli was probably my favorite. The mussels and flat bread were really good too. There were so many options I wanted to order, I will definitely be back.
The decor is pretty modern and gives you a cool chill date night vibe with somewhat dimmer lights. The staff are all very friendly. The drink menu for happy hour is small but that didn't seem to be an issue for us or any of the other customers around.
There bar area is small and parking is crowded after work. I recommend scouting for a space in the garage first and then looking across the street or out front to see if any spaces are available. Otherwise there is some public parking across the cross walk down in a garage."

"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Kim K.","This Italian restaurant was recommended to my husband and I by our son. He was there the Friday before and had the lasagna and couldn't stop talking about it. We went there on Thursday, 1/30 to celebrate my husbands birthday. We went to the bar to have drink before our reservation. Met two different folks there and they both said they were regulars and said this place made the best Italian food in the area. The guy beside me had some cannelloni that looked amazing.
We get seated and was greeted by an amazing young man named Zack. I told him we were hungry and we already knew what we wanted. Lasagna and cannelloni. Well, he took a quick second to recommend a few of their other known favorites of the restaurant. So, my husband got the lasagna and I got the filet. Since the lasagna takes 20 minutes to cook, Zack suggested the Brussels sprouts. They were so tender yet had crispness to them.
Long story short, Zack was amazing and is one of the most engaging, energetic and kindest waiters we have had in a LONG time. Let's just say, if I had to choose my last meal, it would be a meal from Amaro Bistro and exactly what we had for dinner last night.
Oh yes, Zack gave us a complimentary Tiramisu for dessert and it was the BEST we have ever had.
KUDOS to the chef!"
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Christine S.","It makes me so happy that Amaro is in Bothell, because the options for good date night places are pretty thin in the north end. We are here very frequently, and I think I have had everything on their pasta menu, plus some specials.
My husband adores the lasagne, and I also really like it which means something because I don't generally like lasagne at all. My standing favorites though are the canneloni, rigatoni bolognese, and the tortellini. Amaro does a red sauce very, very well.
They have a fantastic wine list (for glasses, the Merf Cab Sauv is unbeatable) and they give you complimentary bread with butter. I am always annoyed when restaurants give you olive oil with the bread, because the oil is such poor quality. To be fair, they do also have oil and vinegar for bread, but I skip it. Overall, I am happy to bring friends and family to Amaro for dinners out and will continue to be here every other weekend."
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Morgan P.","Amaro Bistro swept me off my feet.
Traveling from the tri-state area and growing up with authentic Italian food, I had my doubts trying Italian on the west coast. Before testing my luck, I started with the caprese amaro appetizer that was topped with the most delicious balsamic I've ever had. That's when my tastebuds started spiraling out of control! Every other item that I ordered from there on out was just as good as the last...the salmone..the pollo arrosto..I'm still drooling from it. I probably could have eaten the scraps out of the garbage and it would still be just as delicious.
You don't need to go into Seattle to find good food, take a break from the busy city and relax with a home-y ambiance filled with servers that know how to take care of you.
I can truly say that Amaro Bistro changed my views of west coast Italian."

My husband and I both ordered the salmon entree with wilted greens and potatoes. Everything about it was delish and beautifully played! We will be back for sure!"

The food looks and tastes good, vibrant, and fresh. Our table had the juiciest chicken with risotto, tangy gnocchi, fresh bruschetta, and lasagna. Flavors are bright, and for pasta, the food sits surprisingly light in your stomach. Dessert is a must-order. We had the mascarpone cheesecake and biscotti. Get the mascarpone! Like the food, it feels light and creamy, yet silky and indulgent all the same. The complimentary bread basket is the only thing that didn't score well with me as our bread was dry and the butter was cold/unspreadable. As for drinks, they are solid! The specialty spirits are interesting and sampling is fun with their different flight options. Overall, Amaro offers great food, a comfortable yet upscale ambiance, and outstanding service all for a modest price. My friends brought me, and I'll bring others!"
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Jeehae H.","This place is our go-to place since it's very kid friendly and the food /service is great.
I think we tried a lot of food here and I can confidently say almost everything taste great.
Our go to menu is, Bruschetta (so much diced tomato which we love and you can share with kids), Linguine di Mare (how can you be amazing every single time!), Carbonara (if you are a cream pasta person), and any kind of wood stone fired pizza (personally I like Margehrita).
They also have variety of kids menu and ours love Meatball Spaghetti (their default is Rigatoni but it's a bit chewy for our kid so he loves with the spaghetti noodle).
And the service is great. Very friendly and quick.
I guess the only downside is that it's slightly pricey but worth it. If you are a Microsoft employee, you get one entree free with one entree."

"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rickey M.","Slowly becoming a stop every time I visit back home.
Celebrated the new year by taking my parents up to Roccos during a day in the city, since I was having Funguy cravings.
Came thru Roccos 3ish years ago for the first time, and you wouldnt really think pizza like this existed in Seattle, but they bring their pizza game up a notch above all the rest. It's a bit pricey, but its well worth the price.
This last stop we grabbed half Fun Guy and Half of our own with Pepperoni, sausage, and Jalapenos. I'm gonna say this if you're down with truffle and mushrooms then Fun Guy will be your go to, but if you want to turn it up a notch and want a protein I usually add sausage to the mix, and it becomes its own complete pizza. They're never shy with the toppings, so if you get pepperoni expect more than just a couple on each slice.
What they do with the crust here is pretty special. You know its a good pizza when you eat the whole thing, crust included, and they always hit that perfect spot of a nice soft but crunchy crust.
If you want to taste some of the best a whole large pie is gonna run you about $40, but its a huge pizza. Im guessing 18-20in, so come hungry, but if you dont want a whole pie they have a selection of slices that you can grab up front. You can either eat those in or get them to go. Pair these up with some solid cocktails and you've found yourself a winner in all of Seattle.
Eat here!"
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elie M.","This review is more about the attitude of the doorman / server than the place itself. My gf and I are visiting Seattle from NYC and we wanted to get a late night bite tonight (01.26.2020) so we ended up here...
This doorman asked us for ID's at the entrance which we found odd cause this is a restaurant bar i.e. some folks are getting food some are getting drinks so don't ask for my ID if I'm not ordering alcohol. Curiously, the people who were right behind us weren't asked to provide ID's. My gf had an interim ID (she lost the real one) which is by all means legitimate. She also had a photograph of her passport just in case so we showed that. The guy was extremely rude about her not having a 'real' ID and made it seem like he was doing us a royal favor by letting us in.

We ordered one whole Bahn Mi Pork pizza, half Bahn Mi Portobello pizza (yes they have a vegetarian version!!!), half Veggie Box pizza, and one whole BBQ Pork pizza.
The Banh Mi pizza was still great, but didn't taste as flavorful as usual. Its vegetarian version (with portobello mushroom) tasted almost no difference from the original. I loved it!!! The BBQ Pork was good as always but a bit too cheesy for me, since I'm never a big fan of cheese. I didn't try the Veggie Box but heard that it was okay, not impressive.
As usual, the pizzas were so gigantic that we had half pizza left over."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bruno G.","Not sure what the hype is. We had the Cesar Salad, and it was ok quality, salty, and just like any other you could find much cheaper in any place and not to the standards of very good salads. The we had the meatballs, which came slightly after the salad so they got cold a bit and where not very good, they were mostly lacking sauce. The deluxe cheese bread was our favorite, and that was good.
The service was pretty bad, things came all at once, the server threw the stuff in our table. They wanted us out as quick as possible to sit the next people, and our water was never refilled.
The check was $100 for appetizers and some drinks. Definitely not worth it."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lee A.","Really good pizza and drinks, but not cheap! 3 slices and two drinks will run you $50. Just seems a bit funny for a pizza bar.
The place is small and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait at 9pm on a Friday. I was rather surprised by that, but it's really not a very big place.
We waited 5 minutes and two spots at the bar opened. The bar is nice and betterr than the booths.
Service is not bad, but seemed a bit robotic and not entirely genuine.

The slices are huge and more than enough. The second night I got the BBQ chicken pizza - the bacon and ranch were too sweet for my taste, but the crust was phenomenal.
The staff is friendly and very attentive. I did not have to wait for a table; however, I came at off hours and probably missed the rush."

The pizza tasted just like any other pizza out there & there wasn't an ""omg this is soo good"" moment. I didn't taste anything out of the ordinary. I also didn't like their pepperoni. Our server was great though & he was very attentive. I do love the decor & theme of the pizza parlor, I think that's what makes it unique."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jimmy D.","Pizza came out luke warm for a pizza that was heavier on the cheese. I expected the crust to have a crisp to it since it was reheated, but it was not there either.
Mushroom pizza had a lot of mushrooms, so it was very flavorful. The combo pizza pretty much reminded me of costco pizza. So maybe their toppings are just from costco....
Only thing going is that it was open late and the slices are big. There was a lot left to be desired here.
It was interesting that you need to be seated here for a slice of pizza. I was expecting more of a fast pace for a slice of pie."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gustavo A. L.","After 5 days of nothing but conference hotel food, I was craving a good old fashioned pizza. So I went to Yelp to find the nearest joint and Rocco's came up about a mile away. It was a windy and blustery afternoon so I was hoping the place was worth the long, cold walk from my hotel.
Rocco's came through with flying colors. The service was good despite the fact that they were quite busy. I went with a good vegetable pizza, the portions are quite generous, plenty of toppings to satisfy your cravings and it is done just right.
All this washed down with a good IPA Beer and I was refueled and ready for the trek back to my conference.
I am glad I ventured out to Rocco's as it was a very good experience overall."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer J.","I was looking for a quick and affordable lunch in downtown Seattle, and as I walked by Rocco's the smell of garlic and pizza crust drew me in. I grabbed a seat at the bar, and the gentleman sitting beside me immediately asked if I had been there before. I said no, and he said well you are in for some of the best pizza in Seattle. Of course, I was now even more excited.
I ordered a beer while I took a look at the pizza menu. Luckily they have slices here, so I was able to order two that I wanted to try. The first was a veggie slice, topped with all things amazing goodness. Including two of my favorites, artichoke hearts and goat cheese. It was so delicious I didn't even notice there wasn't any meat on it. Once I saw the size of the slices, I realized I should probably have just gotten one. So I took my second slice, a pulled pork and bacon phenomenon, to go. I enjoyed it later for dinner. Actually I only enjoyed half of it, as I was still pretty full from the first piece! It was smothered in barbecue sauce, amazingly prepared pork, and generous amounts of bacon and cheese.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention how fantastic the crust was at Rocco's. I can see why the dude next to me like that so much. It was crusty, roasty, and perfectly flavored. It made me miss the crust at Goat Mountain Pizza, which used to be my go-to pizza spot in Bellingham.
The service was so friendly and helpful. The bartender will apparently make you a concoction based on your mood and your choice in liquor. While I was tempted, it was more of a beer type of afternoon since I had a lot of things to do. However, I am definitely going to return and have one of his signature cocktails in the future!"

I highly recommend this pizza place for both great customer service and food quality! My husband and I along with two other friends went into this pizza parlor hoping to just satisfy our pizza craving. Boy was it the right decision, we found that this place had several good reviews on yelp and said what the heck let's just try it.
Well when we got there it was a 30 minute wait for a table of 4. Okay, fine, whatever put us on the waiting list. We were finally called up by the awesome security guy and went in to try the food.
We were sat on a nice round table towards the end of the bar/pizza parlor. We ordered drinks and commented to the waiter that the boys were starving. We were about to order two pizzas when he said ""I've had several previous customers who are only able to finish one pizza, do you want to try that and order more if you're still hungry?"" Everyone said sure fine let's do that.
So we ordered a nice appetizer of mozzarella cheese sticks with alcohol beverages. Hmm were those cheese sticks delicious! Highly recommend the pizza, the mozzarella cheese sticks, and the some beverages to go with it.
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I don't know what other way to put it (:"

"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alan G.","I had heard great things, but I wasn't truly prepared. Now don't get scared off by the $40 pizza prices - a full pizza can comfortably feed a group of 4 people. And it's one of the best pizzas in Seattle.
I came here for before going to a show at the Crocodile one night. Dave was our friendly and charismatic waiter. My wife ordered the best cocktail ever - called something like I'm In Love With An Actual Legend. It was delicious, but most importantly it came with the words tiniest clothes pin.
My favorite pizza we ordered was the Jalapano Popper style one. I didn't know that this was a thing somebody could do with a pizza. And good lord I'm glad they did! Also the goat cheese and beets appetizer was amazing, but the cheesy bread is worth ordering if you're the less adventurous type.
Oh yeah! They also do single slices as well! So you don't have to break the bank for a single serving meal.
Bottom line: go to Rocco's ASAP."

We got:
- a regular cheese slice 8/10: was pretty good, nothing super spectacular though
- mushroom slice 9/10: mmmm i really enjoyed this mushroom one. It had a looot of mushrooms which i really enjoyed"
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brian F.","I had to come back during dinner time to give this place another shot!
We came on a Monday evening and got seated right away for a party of three. The cool thing is that you can order half pizzas so you can try different types. We ordered a pizza with half fun-guy and half lasagna. I loved the fun guy and the truffle flavors but I think I preferred the lasagna one more because it has meat (I'm a carnivore, what can I say? Sorry not sorry).
It does seem a little pricey for pizza but it is really good and the portions are huge! Each of my friends and I only ate two slices each before we called it and we can eat a lot. We had two slices leftover that we took to go. They also have a couple other options that intrigued me like the tikka tikka tikka, BBQ chicken, and banh mi that I might just have to come back again to try."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sara C.","This is my favorite pizza place in Seattle! I always send people here, and when I first discovered Rocco's, I was coming here once a week. From their fresh salads (wait for the parmesan crisp), to their rotating pizza menu, to their creative cocktails, you really can't go wrong. I love having the option to grab a slice and go, or sit down and enjoy my present company.
Be warned, plenty of other people like this place too, you can often find a line out the door during dinner hour or late night. It's great pizza, I'm telling you! Rocco's resides in a small place, but I can't wait for their new spot to open up."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Johanna M.","I arrived dumb late on a Sunday night, only to find many restaurants around my hotel were already closed. I needed some food, and I didn't want to sit down anywhere. I pulled out my trusty yelp app and found Rocco's. Anytime I can get a slice to go, I'm game.
I walked over and was shocked to find the way we're playing Pete Rock. Oh snap! A little unexpected. It's my first time in Seattle, so I'm happy to find hip hop heads who appreciate pizza. I ordered my slice of cheese to go, and only had to wait a few minutes, which was enjoyable b/c Pete Rock...duh. The space is dope too. It is dark, like a speakeasy, but hiding in plain sight. It has nice booths and big windows out front for people watching. It's also really chill and private for a date. I saw a few couples in there.
They serve a solid slice of cheese. I'm only sad I was traveling alone, so I could order a pie, but I will be back when I'm in town again, and I'll be bringing a friend. I love to share good food spots, and this spot is a gem."
"Rocco’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/roccos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ronda A.","We went to Seattle for the very first time and really wanted some pizza so my husband found this place. As soon as we walked in the ambience was very warm and cozy. We started off with the Deluxe Cheese Bread and OMG, it was absolutely amazing. It looks a lot like a mini Stromboli and tasted perfect. For our pizza we both have different tastes and luckily this place allows you to do half-and-half pizzas. My husband got the Chicken Pesto and I got the Banh Mi (no pulled pork). Wow. Wow. Wow. That's all we kept saying as we were eating our first slices. The pizza was the best pizza I've ever had in my life and I'm from NY so that means a lot. The size was huge and we weren't prepared haha. Since we were leaving Seattle the next day we went to the store, got Ziploc bags, and took the rest back to North Carolina with us. (Yes we took it on the plane with us, it's was THAT good.) Service was perfect and everyone there was super friendly. As I mentioned earlier this place is very cozy and there's not a lot of seating. Luckily we went right before it got busy for dinner. I would recommend that if you're going for dinner book your reservation in advance on OpenTable to avoid a long wait. Can't wait to go back to Seattle and give this place another go!"
"LOCAL Terry Ave","https://www.yelp.com/biz/local-terry-ave-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Michael S.","We were staying in LOCAL and decided it would be the best place for us to eat during our stay in Seattle.
The restaurant has a huge sign that makes it easy to find. We were there on Friday and Saturday nights and sat in the bar area. The happy hour menu is good and worth it, but it isn't a super value or anything, just decent. We got the fish tacos the first visit, which were as good as everyone says! We got a sandwich and the poke bowl the second night, and were just as pleased with our meals.
Overall the food and beer is good and we'd be back. The music playing is just a touch too loud, but I've definitely been in worse. We were a little surprised to find they were playing very, very explicit music, and even pumped that music into their outdoor area. We aren't the type to be offended, but if you are, maybe consider another spot."
"LOCAL Terry Ave","https://www.yelp.com/biz/local-terry-ave-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Lindsey S.","This is a great place to watch sports and hangout with large groups of friends. The Oregon Ducks and Washington Huskies were playing on Saturday, and we were searching for a place with TV's. We came across this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it out. Upon walking in, you seat yourself. We sat at the corner of the bar so we could catch glimpses of both the football game and the Seattle Sounders game on the other TV. There were only two people working behind the bar, but they were really quick to help out everyone and make sure they were doing well. The customer service was great for how busy it was.
We ordered the hash for brunch, curry, and reuben sandwich for the three of us. I got the curry, and it was better than anticipated. When I saw it on the menu, I was hesitant to order because this restaurant didn't seem to specialize in Asian food, but I ended up developing a craving for it. The curry was thick and had a nice spice to it. The snap peas were crunchy and complimented both the soft rice and grilled chicken. I would order again. I tried the hash and reuben, and both were so tasty, and came in large portions. I'm looking forward to coming back to catch another game and try some other menu items and drinks!"

It was the perfect place to relax and wind down after a long flight! Everywhere else in the downtown area near my hotel was closed. I sat at the bar since half of the regular sitting area was closed off.
The drinks were good; nice and strong lol! I ended up getting the Italian Margarita. Super refreshing!
They have a late night menu with good deals. I got the fish tacos because I love tacos lol and the poutine.
I also got the cinnamon sugar donuts. They tasted like beignets rolled in cinnamon and powdered sugar. Don't forget to dip in the sauce!
Overall the atmosphere was super chill and not crowded for a Friday night. The music was perfect since it was early 2000s and the bartender that served us was on point! Super attentive! Great service!"

"LOCAL Terry Ave","https://www.yelp.com/biz/local-terry-ave-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","Popular pub in the heart of Amazon campus with a good happy hour and drink specials.
I have been to LOCAL a handful of times when in the area, and it is always pretty busy/starting to get busy when I arrive - especially if it's the end of a work day.
The restaurant itself is very large, and they have drink specials each day of the week. The food is pretty standard pub food, but always good to munch on - I would maybe come here to eat a burger, but otherwise stick around for the apps. The service has always been good, and they allow dogs in the outside area.
Recently, co-workers and I met up for drinks and I got a glass of the 'mystery red' and then a sauv blanc. The wines were average, but I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing. They do have an extensive beer list so if you prefer beer, it's probably going to satisfy you more than those of us who are wine drinkers.
We ordered nachos (without the meat), which come with a really flavorful salsa on it - and we ordered the pierogies. Honestly, the pierogies were a little bland but regardless were still dumplings filled with potatoes and cheese (I'm also maybe a little biased as someone who lived in Pennsylvania).
TL;DR - great place to grab drinks after work and munch on bites, but probably wouldn't head here for dinner."
"LOCAL Terry Ave","https://www.yelp.com/biz/local-terry-ave-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Tammy L.","Okay, the food is good. I get the veggie burger, and while the patty is delicious, it completely falls apart. I think the recipe could be tweaked just a little to produce a burger that holds better. The menu has large variety of options. I went with someone else who ordered a patty melt type of burger. He felt that his burger was burnt and he didn't really care for it. This place has the best guacamole and chips, hands down. It tastes fresh and made to order.
It is a hippy type of vibe, and if you go on the weekend it is packed to the ceiling.
The service has been amazing both times I've been here."

The burger was cooked nicely and seasoned really well. The service started out really good, but when it came time to settle the bill, it was difficult to find my server. Took a bit to get the check and then a bit longer to get my card back. I would recommend coming here but give yourself a bit of time since it was busy and things took bit long for everything."

I split a Local Fried Chicken with my teammate and ordered one Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl for myself. The fried chicken was dry and crispy. The seasoning on the skin had really good flavor, but the meat inside was bland. My Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl was super delicious - fresh, tasty seasoning, great combination of ingredients (flavor-wise and texture-wise). I really liked the fried tofu in it, and it's even better that I could swap out the rice with salad :) However, it was overpriced - $17 for a poke bowl."

It is a large establishment with a nice sized bar, a bar dining area and dining room and outside eating area. We asked our server for tips and there are house specials marked on the menu, our eye caught the appetizers - dumplings and garlic veggies and we ordered the chicken sandwich and a custom burger pictured below.
To the staffs credit they have amazing beer and wine and we ordered mixed drinks, which considering the food weren't as good as everything else here. The food is good, staff is fun and neighborhood is awesome you are a couple blocks from the water which made for a great after dinner activity"

"LOCAL Terry Ave","https://www.yelp.com/biz/local-terry-ave-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jeremy C.","This is one of my favorite spots in SLU. My wife and I came here after being ignored at Sams, and we made the right choice (see my review of Sams, which I'm not a fan of).
We came on a busy Saturday afternoon, and unlike Sam's we were greeted upon arrival. The attentive service continued throughout our time there despite them being fully packed - including the outdoor patio (it was sunny the last time we visited). Overall it was an open, welcoming atmosphere where they even display many of their kegs through glass above the TV's, which is a nice touch. Speaking of TV's, they had many of them throughout the restaurant, but they were high enough to not be overwhelming. They also played music instead of the TV audio, so the verdict is still out as to whether or not it would be a good place to catch a Hawks game.
The food is consistent and very good. And the guacamole was better than most Mexican restaurants in the area with big, fresh chucks of avocado throughout. They have a great selection of food, and an even better drink selection - including shots of Rose, which my wife appreciated!
The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because while they advertise happy hour every day on their signs outside, our bill did not reflect the happy hour price for any of the happy hour items we ordered (hint: the guac is on happy hour). I'm guessing it was either a mistake on our bartenders part, or they recently changed their happy hour rules without updating their signage."
"LOCAL Terry Ave","https://www.yelp.com/biz/local-terry-ave-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Kelly S.","First ever dog-friendly restaurant I've ever tried. I'm a first-time dog owner so I didn't even know this was a thing. How is this even health-department approved? In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Staff and patrons alike were friendly toward my puppy which eased my anxiety.
I had their deluxe burger, others had fish taco's, and edamame. The food was fine - pretty middle of the road, but the fourth star is really for the overall experience with friendly staff and the novelty of dining with four-legged friends.

The food is absolutely delicious, and the staff is friendly and usually well organized. I typically get one of the vegetarian pizzas and my husband gets prosciutto with arugula. Both of our pizzas come out perfect and piping hot! The prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is solid. Also I love their spicy oil! Delicious!
Pizzeria 22 is not as ""cute"" as Mioposto, but I prefer Pizzeria 22 because the service is MUCH better, and I like the food better. Plus the prices are comparable or lower, and the menu has greater variety.
Note: I knocked off one star because we did have one experience where the service was *really* bad. There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant, and I believe she was new. We waited for a LONG time for her to even take our drink orders, and then much longer than normal for our orders to come. However this has not been my typical experience at Pizzeria 22."
"Pizzeria 22","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-22-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","5 stars for the fact that you can add an egg to any pizza. A+ concept.
In all seriousness, Pizzeria 22 is a great little pizza place hidden in West Seattle. It's fairly priced, and has a pretty large menu with good options for us non-meat eaters. To be honest, the menu is probably my only issue with this place - everything on it looks delicious, but each of the items are a little too similar so it can make it hard to decide on what to order.
Our staff here was friendly, and the restaurant itself has a quality 'ma and pop' feel (read: it's not pretentious, and could be either a low-key date place or somewhere to bring the fam). The wine pours are very generous, and you'll enjoy the large portion sizes of pizza, too. I can't wait to convince my friends in West Seattle to grab pizza with me again!"
"Pizzeria 22","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-22-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Steph G.","A group of 20 came here for our friends birthday and we all left extremely happy with our bellies wonderfully full. I had never heard of Pizzeria 22, but that's also probably because I can count the times I've been to West Seattle on my two hands. The location is sort of hidden on a side street and requires street parking or there is a lot right across the street where you can pay to park ((+++ it's mobile pay to park!)).
The restaurant is pretty small and split into two sections. The main entrance leads you right into the bar with some tables and and around the corner is the bigger area with more seating and where we took over for the lovely evening. It was nice that the place wasn't crowded as we were able to walk around and mingle.
The drinks were strong! I ordered a Frizzante which I anticipated would be on the lighter side since it was Prosecco with vermouth and Campari. But man was it strong! It was very tasty but I ended up sipping on it throughout the entire evening. Expect heavy pours! Of course this is not a bad thing!
Everyone was super thrilled with their pizzas but mine was SPECTACULAR! Order the Quattro Formaggi + Prosciutto - Olive Oil, Fresh Mozzarella, Goat Cheese, Gorgonzola, Grana, Cherry Tomato, Garlic, Fresh Basil & Oregano -$20 YUM!! I love that they give everyone scissors to cut their slices, adds a nice touch. I cannot wait to come back and order the same pizza, but also nibble on their amazing appetizers and try their desserts!"

Wonderful accommodating staff! Pizza is great, cal-zone are even better and they have large pours for mixed drinks.
The pizza has a great burnt crust that has great texture and kind a reminds me a bit of naan bread. They have some spicy oil that you can have to drizzle on the pizza that provides a good hit of spicy when mixed with the red pepper flakes.
Inside seating can be a bit cramped when the bar stools are occupied as leaves little space between bar and wall seating. I couldn't imagine all the bar stools & wall seating filled to capacity as it would appear like a Boeing 737.
Overall, Pizza 22 is a gem of a pizza place and one of the Top 3 I've been to in Seattle. We will definitely be back and become regulars as long as my stomach girth can take it."

And unfortunately it's not always 5 stars. That being said, I LOVE their pizza and I just can't justify docking a star. The only reason I would is the service. Sometimes, if you come during peak hours, the service is just terrible. One time I ordered a pizza for takeout, they told me it'd be 20 minutes, when I got there, I had to wait AN HOUR for my pizza.
So I mean, that was my worst experience there. But I keep coming back for more because their pizza is just so damn good. Honestly, closest thing I've found to true Italian pizza in Seattle.
I ordered the maragharita DOC pizza, it's one of my favorites. But I've also had the radicce which is amazing.

We've walk past the restaurant quite a few times and finally said ""Let's give it a try, it's always got a consistent patronage."" Needless to say, I'm glad we stopped in for dinner. The atmosphere is split with the front being more dark and intimate and the other side being more open. Either way, the staff is on top of it with speed and recommendations. This is a traditional Neapolitan style pizzeria with exceptional starters, salads, and obviously pizza.
For two, I recommend getting the clams (local PNW caught - fresh) and veal meatballs as starters. Follow with the insalata verde (green salad with pancetta and gorgonzola). Finally, end with a pizza (any are great).
This meal was SO GOOD!"

We ordered takeout through the yelp app and it was done right on time. They offer delivery or pickup. The crust is thin and delicious and the toppings are just right. We ordered the Al Pepperoni and the Prosciutto Primavera. Both equally excellent in their own ways. The pepperoni had just enough sauce and mozzarella. The prosciutto and arugula were fresh and the slightly cooked tomatoes really added flavor. It's worth checking out, especially if West Seattle is your neighborhood."

"Pizzeria 22","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-22-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jim P.","I have wanted to try this place for a while, finally had the opportunity to do so. I ordered to go but sat at the bar and had a martini which was solid.
As a grabbed my 2 boxes to go (1 ceasar salad 1 prosciutto pizza) it occurred to me that these boxes are lighter than air and actually wondered if anything was in them?
Upon arriving at me house I was happy to see there actually was pizza and salad in there.
The salad was good but not sure it was 10.00 good. Fresh, large cut romaine, a few house made croutons, some shaved parm... the normal. But dang dudes... that's a handsome price for a single salad.
The pizza on the other hand tasted good. Very sparse with the toppings but they all worked well together. The outside crust would be exactly what I want with a wood fired pizza, crunchy...doughy...Yep. The bottom crust was super thin and soft (whaa whaa whaa) and in no way could hold up to the weight of the sauce and toppings. Even to fold it - it still pointed south as to say it doesn't want to go into my mouth.
All in all the meal was good, but not sure if it was 50.00 good (including tip) but I think I would like to dine in and try their pasta. Maybe better luck, I'll let you know"

If you like these things, you will love Pizzeria 22.
Our order was wrong so, we talked with a staff member, who was definitely not caring, and really sounded like he was not sober or not high.
Asked to talk to the manager and I was told he couldn't be bothered.
I'm never EVER going here again. HORRIBLE experience."
"Pizzeria 22","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-22-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","L G.","If you like cold pizza, salads that could kill you and horrific service, this is the place for you. This was a restaurant I have loved in the past. Celebrated my 40th birthday party here, lots of date nights here, have recommended it to many, many people here in West Seattle. I will NEVER go here again. You have lost my business and I will tell everyone to go to Mio Posto (which I hear is amazing) down the street. Heck, you'd get better customer service from Sbarro in a mall food court. I ordered a pizza and salad through grub hub tonight. Pizza was delivered 40 minutes late, was cold and they sent the wrong salad. When I called Pizzeria 22, I was told it wasn't their fault and I needed to call Grub Hub. They also told me the pizza was sitting there for 30 minutes waiting to be picked up. Do they not have any pride on what they serve? I explained how frustrated I was that my pizza was completely cold and that they sent the wrong salad. On top of that, the romaine on the salad was pink and wilted...and it's caesar salad which I am allergic to because of the anchovies. The young guy who answered the phone was very nice and tried talking with the ""manager"" of the restaurant. I could hear their entire conversation. The ""manager"" (sounded like an older guy) did not care about the situation at all. He didn't have the courtesy to even get on the phone...instead he sounded like an a-hole to this poor kid and didn't offer an apology for the wrong salad that THEY sent. They blamed the cold pizza on the delivery guy which is probably true and not why I called. My main issue with them was the wrong salad which the delivery guy told me to call the restaurant. I am not one who posts negative reviews and I get the pressure that small businesses are under but I have totally written off this restaurant. On a Sunday night, I can't imagine the ""manager"" not having the time to apologize for their mistake or offer a free salad next time I come to dine. I get grub hub is potentially at fault for the cold pizza but the ""manager"" needs to be fired for his heartless attitude."

I sat at the bar area. It was cramped and close to the kitchen so lots of employees were working around me. Not a very comfortable dining experience since I felt like I was in the way.

The sauce disappeared with the other toppings so would have been nice to have more flavor and spices.

When we walked in it was a little busy on a very cold and rainy evening. After being inside a couple of minutes, someone finally approached us and we expected to be greeted and asked how many in our party. Instead, the hostess said to us and another group, ""Don't block the door. Wait at the bar or stand outside."" After a couple of minutes, she finally returned and checked us in. Whilst waiting, we observed her role her eyes multiple times when new parties arrived and others were complaining as to her attitude as well. Our waitress was polite, but not overly welcoming. Our drink from the bar (dirty martini) arrived watered down (which we assumed the bar tender left it in the ice too long). The waitress replaced it and apologized. Overall, the pizza was good, the waitress was good, but the overall experience was not one that will ever bring us back. I'd rather have a nice evening out with friends and family, rather than eating at a place with great food and feel like an inconvenience and that my business wasn't appreciated. The experience ruined the evening. It didn't feel as if the staff were overwhelmed and the customer service was lackluster at best. Skip this restaurant.
I'd highly recommend the Masonry over this restaurant in LQA next to UPS and kitty-corner to Metropolitan Market. Much different ambiance, but better pizza and service."

I often go to Molly Moon next door and notice Via Tribunali next door. We had just visited Italy and was craving authentic Neapolitan pizza! Unfortunately Via Tribunali pizza fell short of all the advertisement and rave. The tomato sauce was tasty, but the other ingredients were short on quality. The crust was very chewy and lacked crunch. The bottom of the pizza was very burnt and made both pizza taste bitter.
We ordered the Margherita and Capricciosa Pizza. To make matters even less enjoyable was the lack of service, borderline rude. Two and a half stars at best. This would be my first and last visit to Via Tribunali."

The veggies on my pizza were very fresh, and it had a healthy topping of goat cheese - my favorite! We also ordered some desserts to share, and extra salads which we ended up enjoying for breakfast the next morning.

No espresso, no drip. Call me an idiot, but if they sell cake, cookies, etc. on cold winter nights, wouldn't it make sense to have either drip or espresso available? Does it take 2 hours to clean the machines? Guess it's back to Victrola or Vivace. Try to support local restaurants, help me out a little."
"Little Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gypsy G.","I've tried a lot of pizzas in this town, and Little Lago has one of the best. Our favorite is the Salsiccia Pepperoni - great sauce, crispy crust, and a sweet and (lightly) spicy flavor. I wish I could comment on the other menu items, but we are kind of addicted to the Salsiccia at the moment. A pizza per person typically feeds us.
Customer service is always quick and friendly.
I only wish that the restaurant/cafe portion was just a bit bigger, as half of the space is allocated to groceries. Some context on this: The neighborhood would not let any businesses operate a full fledged restaurant/cafe here, so hence the poor use of space. On the upside, it's fun to peruse the shelves while you wait for your order. Makes you feel like you're overseas, looking at specialty groceries, where the price is not a concern because you don't feel like doing the exchange rate conversion in your head. It's a sweet little neighborhood cafe."

Perfect place to pick up really good produce - small selection and a little pricey (understandably based on the prices in our neighborhood and they can't compete with the quantity buys of a Safeway), but every single item I have bought is fresh and perfect. They also have a great selection of dry goods, wines and a small curated deli case. You can pick up the best roasted chicken you'll ever eat, perfectly cooked flatbread pizza (mushroom and fontina is my favorite) and sandwiches, salads, fresh baked pastries and muffins etc. The owner, Carla also owns the restaurant Cafe Lago on 24th Ave E in Montlake.

We weren't greeted and the overall vibe was standoffish from the two members of the evening staff at the register.

Every interaction (over a dozen times this past year) I have had seems to be an annoyance for the person working.

"Little Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","George T.","Found Little Lago to stop in on a daylight-savings Sunday for brunch. I'm gonna be upfront and say I'm going to digress rn from a review of the restaurant because I've always been confused with the necessity of daylight-savings. I mean, it seems like more trouble than it's worth and we, as human beings with time-keeping devices like watches, clocks, and sundials, should be able to just deal with the sun setting later without having to observe this semi-annual ruse to fool ourselves. The worse part of daylight-savings is ""losing"" an hour each Spring. What the heck am I saving, exactly?*
Well, back to the review.
A combination of a neighborhood bakery, deli, and small market, Little Largo reminds me of Clementines in Century City, Los Angeles (my old neighborhood in LA), except with fewer selections of deli items. Pricing is definitely on the higher side, but that probably has to do with the economics of being in that particular neighborhood? Parking was available directly in front, with a loading zone that could be used on Sunday (check the parking rules for Seattle for yourself, please).
I had their arugula salad with a 1/4 pound each of their chicken/apple salad and roasted cauliflower deli offerings. Quite delicious, although I would have preferred a little less dressing in the arugula salad. Maybe I should have just asked for said selections to be served on a bed of plain arugula because there definitely was enough flavor to carry the plate.
My son and his girlfriend both ordered sandwiches, and shared a lavender cookie between them while we were waiting for our food (they're in college, so too old for me to scold them about sweets before a meal). I could only watch on as they made short work of it because my cheat day was the day before (FYI, cheat day was glorious)--okay, I did snag the tiniest piece of crumb to, yes, confirm that the cookie tasted as good as it looked.
We were there for about an hour, and as late as 2:00pm there was still a healthy amount of traffic coming into the establishment. Whether that was due to the effects of daylight-savings or otherwise, it's hard to tell.
Given its proximity to UW and my preference to frequent anywhere with easy parking I am pretty positive we'll be back.
*Note: I am all for observing daylight-savings in the fall because we can all use at least one ""do-over"" hour every year."

The HH menu was very reasonably priced. I had Cava, Caesar salad, and fried chicken sandwich. The Cava was a good glass of bubbles for $7. (My standard is Vueve to give you context of my taste)The salad dressing could have had a little more salt, anchovies and garlic, however the croutons were delicious. I had to try the fried chicken sandwich because it's hard to pass up friend chicken and it didn't disappoint; crispy, tasty goodness at a great value.
My friend had an Old Fashion or two and the burger from the main menu. She said it was as good as it looked and didn't give me the opportunity to steal a fry.
Will definitely go back to try something off

We sat at the bar, which is a gorgeous space. The entire restaurant is done in blues and whites, with a mirrored bar area, and features photos and art of the nearby lake. We were promptly greeted by the friendly bartender; the house cocktail I had contained mezcal and was delicious. We split a small charcuterie plate, which was very reasonably priced and had two cheeses, two meats, jam, mustard, crackers and pickled onions. My husband had the French dip; it was a large portion on crusty bread that stood up to the sandwich. The fries on the side were perfectly done. I had the mushroom pappardelle that also had pork belly and apples - perfect for fall and finished with the perfect amount of salt. Service was attentive and friendly and the ambiance is warm and inviting - we'll be back!"
"Nick’s On Madison","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nick-s-on-madison-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","CJ B.","A pleasant addition to the neighborhood with a bar and table seating. We went for happy hour and tried the sliders (very yummy), the Caesar salad and the charcuterie board to go with a gin and tonic and an Old Fashioned . All were reasonably priced and nicely presented. We tried the grilled peach desert which was a slightly undercooked combination of streusel, peaches and ice cream.
A nice addition to the neighborhood with a friendly vibe. We will definitely return."

We shared 4 of their nicely presented and flavorful appetizers and then we each selected a different entree (skirt steak, hamburger, gnocchi, and a strawberry salad). Each entree received a 5-star rating for flavor and presentation. We finished the evening with grilled peaches and flourless chocolate cake, both with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
It was a wonderful evening, in a very comfortable environment and served by a thoughtful, attentive and friendly staff.
We look forward to our next visit."

"Nick’s On Madison","https://www.yelp.com/biz/nick-s-on-madison-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marko P.","My friend had a pretty good painted hills beef burger that she gave me a piece of. It was very juicy and would have been great had it not been so over salted.
The Caesar salad had nice crisp romaine lettuce. The dressing was light and tasty. I think they were rationing the Parmesan cheese. I would have liked more than a couple slivers.
Ending on a more positive note...the hand cut fries were delicious and perfectly seasoned. The baguette with butter was good, like it ought to be. It was fresh, crunchy and chewy and would have been lovely if I could have swapped it 'buttered and toasted' french dip sandwich bread."

The ambiance feels homey light and airy. It's a bit loud but that also increases the feeling of community in the space. We both had the French dip sandwiches with the Brussel sprout side. The French dip at nicks is now one of our favs. And we are connoisseurs of French dip Sammy's. The au jus is so good I could drink it. Salty and deeply beefy. The bread was crusty yet soft and didn't get soggy as we ate. The beef was flavorful, sliced super thin and flavorful. The Brussels were steamed then seared so tender yet Smokey in a delicious sauce. My husband demolished the fries saying they were his favorite. Super excited to have a great restaurant in an area that needs more great restaurants. Nicely done nick."

We arrived around 6pm and it was about half full, chose to sit at the bar. The place is somehow both elegant and casual. Very nice, comfortable and at first almost too quiet but within about half an hour it was filling up and really hopping. Clearly this place is already a favorite amongst neighborhood folks. The bartender was super friendly and Nick, the owner came by and introduced himself and explained some details about the amazing photos displayed on the walls. Even though this place is new, it is definitely very Madison Park - with beautiful photos of the area. We had the Bibb Salad with beets - delish, the black bean burger - also yummy, but most wonderful was the halibut - it was beautiful and absolutely perfectly cooked and presented. Highly recommended!!!"

Dining area was lovely, with . super comfy, beautiful cobalt blue (at least at night) velvety cushions on the chairs. Service was spot on - warm and friendly. I ordered the French Dip sandwich, which was one of the best sandwiches of any kind I've ever had. Perfectly thin slices of beef, with cheese and horseradish aioli (asked for extra for the fries). Took half home and it was just as good the next day. My friend had the house-made papperdelle with local wild mushrooms, and she did a bit of a swoon over it. Neither of us found room for dessert, but will try it next time. Nick came out to ask how things were, and was very welcoming, which is always appreciated. Definitely a place I want to take more of my friends to."

"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen N.","This is the favorite go to place for my family and me in Seattle. We love the personal attention, we love the food, we love the intimate setting, and we love the atmosphere. The setting is small, intimate and casual. It's like being invited into Pino's house, sitting down, and being served a meal.
On occasion, some of us have spent up to four hours at Pino's, chatting and talking with the Pino regulars who stop by regularly and are like extended family. Pino periodically comes by and sees how things are going, brings out more food, and when the bottle is empty opens another bottle of wine or refreshes the water pitcher.
If you crave luxurious atmosphere, fawning wait-staff, and full-blown menus, this isn't your place. If you want to feel as if you stopped by to visit friends and family in a small southern Italian villa, this should be your spot. To appreciate Cafe da Pino, don't go to get a meal. Go to become part of a family. Because at its best, Cafe da Pino isn't about food; it's about relationship, with food and wine as the lubricant."
"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Stefanie M.","Love this place! Pino is the best host and chef. Must make reservation but so worth the wait!

"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen N.","Stopped by for dinner with family friend from out of dinner. The dinner was excellent, matched only by the casual atmosphere and Pino's hospitality.
An important change - the restaurant is now open for dinner by reservation only. Pino cooks for your reservation, and that is all he prepares. If you walk up, expecting to be seated, you probably won't be. (That happened to one group while we were there.)
If you have some food preferences or restrictions, that needs to be conveyed when you make your reservation."
"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Anne M.","The place across from Cafe da Pino had a 40 minute wait so we went into Pino's to get an appetizer and a drink.
We didn't notice he was actually closed but when we came in he said I'm making sausage, give me 10 minutes. So we waited for him to finish.
He recommended some wine for us and as we got ready to order he asked us if we wanted to order or wanted him to take care of us. We told him please take care of us. When a chef asks that should be the only answer. :)
He served us a couple plates of his house cured meats and homemade cheese. The entree was a bolognese on penne. It was very good. Don't expect this food to be highly spiced with garlic and Italian seasonings. One thing I discovered when travelling through Italy is most of the food doesn't come garlicy or heavily spiced. This tasted authentic.
As we ate some of 'the guys' came by for dinner which made the ambiance friendly and welcoming. We knew we were experiencing something special... which we knew to these guys was 'just Wednesday'.
Dessert was the lemon cake which was made by one of 'the guys'. It was light and not overly sweet and very delicious.
Pino offered some of his lemoncello which was creamy and smooth and we happily killed the bottle for him.
The tab for all that food was reasonable for 4 people: 2 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 pieces of cake and about 5 shots of lemoncello came to about $200.
He also will do special woodfired pizza parties. He doesn't use email. He said he uses smoke signals. You have to go in person to arrange anything special.
Pino may come off as a bit rough around the edges but he's very warm and loves cooking for people."

Last night we returned for a simple meal of roasted vegetables, lasagna and lemon mousse cake. At home, I've been cooking Italian dishes a couple of times a week and consider my skills ""decent"". The owner puts my feeble efforts to shame - he is a Chef! The vegetables were perfect, the lasagna superb and the lemon mousse cake exquisite!

"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Hai Yen N.","He's a one-man band and a MacGyver of furnishing patios; Pino is the owner/chef/host/server of Cafe da Pino and the dining experience here is intimate, authentic, and charming. This little osteria is a well-priced gem in Ravenna for delicious, unpretentious Italian. The menu is succinct, just barely over a dozen dishes including insalatas, soups, entrees, and desserts, with the only pasta choice being penne.
We started with the caprese salad: sweet, juicy red and orange tomato slices separated by rounds of tangy mozzarella dressed lightly with balsamic and olive oil and a scattering of dried basil and oregano. This was refreshing and delicious but I was disappointed not to see fresh basil leaves. The penne bolognese was a winner; the meat seasoned impeccably and the pasta al dente and toothsome. If there is a meat dish, order it! Meat is Pino's specialty and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you left without trying the spectacularly flavorful meatballs."

After taking our first bite we are both overwhelmingly field with that feeling. Maybe our problem was how we chose to order off the specials board. My penne with house- made sausage and marinara it was no more memorable than something from a can of Chef Boyardee with some extra fennel seeds thrown in. My partners beet ravioli-$18 for seven pieces!-was drowning in a pink sea of unseasoned flavorless beet goo. You can leave your Kraft shake cheese at home-Pino's already uses plenty of it. I have never seriously considered walking out on a restaurant bill until this meal."
"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Mandy C.","My friend and I stopped by da Pino and had high hopes because of its cute and cozy appearance. We are by no means foodies, or experts in Italian food (we even enjoy Olive Garden occasionally), but our experience here was extremely poor. I got the tortellini with marinara sauce, and she got the ravioli with cream sauce, peas and prosciutto. The marinara sauce tasted like it was from a jar and the pasta could have been from a Buitoni package. The ""prosciutto"" was flavorless and thick- we think it may have been ham or Canadian bacon. The parmesan was not fresh; it was, no joke, from a Kraft canister. The bread was dry and the service bland. To top it off, the portions are small and the prices high. Where is the authentic Italian food others have mentioned? Extremely disappointed."
"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Erica D.","I havent been to a terrible place in a long time. We had high hopes because of the house made meats.

Pino is a master of Italian style cured meats. Nothing is this good in town short of Salumi. I usually order one of the specials. Last night I had the tortellini with peas and prosciutto. Delicious filling in the tortellini and his prosciutto is the best. Got a couple of salamis to take home as well.
Maybe this place isn't for everyone, portions are not huge, but it's my kind of no fuss neighborhood place. The atmosphere is a bit cramped and tacky, and Pino might appear to be a cranky old guy, but he warms up pretty quickly."

I could have made this dish at home for half the cost, and I was still hungry when I was done eating. It came with bread that was tasteless and not very fresh.

"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Belikewater W.","Pino Rogano is the Calabria native proprietor of this salumeria (Italian cured meat shop / delicatessen) in Ravenna. After several years in Garlic Gulch (Rainier Valley) next to Mondo's Meats he moved back north not too far from his former restaurant that he sold back in 1989 on Roosevelt Way - Verdi's Caffe del'Opera (now Salvatore Ristorante Italiano) to return to Italy to hone his artisan craft of curing meat. He won the best salami at the 1st Annual Salumi Curing Contest locally. He was the chef at the former Settebello. Now he mostly supplies restaurants (Lampreia, Assaggio, Matt's in The Market, to name a few) with his cured meats (Prosciutto, Coppa, Sopressata, Cotecchino, and his specialty wild boar sausage which he sources the meat from Oregon).
I ducked-in (rolled up on my Ducati '05 Monster 1000S) for his daily pasta lunch special for only $8 because I was referred here by a native Italian that dines here regularly and I had the rigatoni with sausage (rigatoni con salsiccia). I also had a Peroni beer (wine available too), Lavazza espresso, and his Limoncello mousse for dessert. He makes the Limoncello in house also and I tried a sampling (Squisito!). I'm told this is the place to go for hot sandwiches too (I'll be back!). It is a tiny quaint place with only 4 tables inside (outside seating available, weather permitting) open for lunch and dinner and closes at 7:30pm (closed Sunday). Ravenna/U.District/U.Village you don't need to go wait in line at lunch for an italian sandwich like those in Pioneer Square/Downtown do at that other salumeria because there's no line here yet. Pass Subway/Quiznos and run here. Great basic authentic Italian food at a great price! cafedapino.com"

Ravioli in a puree of beets and walnuts was a deep red tempered by the walnuts. Get anything that features the meats. And get it today."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Christina K.","I am so happy the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed tonight because Como was an exceptional find! The ambience is very unlike ""Eastside"" eateries...ie it is charming and elegant without being pretentious or trying too hard. It is fresh and welcoming and the staff are fantastic.
Now to the food - Spinasse is our go-to for fresh-made pasta and perfect Italian dishes in Seattle and I dare say, Como gives it a run for its money. We ordered the rainbow beet salad with ricotta and pistachios, pappardelle with wild boar ragu, tajine with shaved mushrooms, black cod with watercress and pomegranate and for dessert hazelnut affogato and almond cannoli.
Everything was perfect: the pastas were fresh and light, with just the tight amount of sauce to balance the pasta; the fish was so tender and perfectly flaky, the desserts....super yum and the espresso from the hammered copper espresso machine was a delightful end.
I loved this place. We sat at the marble-topped bar and will warm these seats again! Loved Como and hope you all give it a try! I desperately want more places like this on the Eastside so please go and help keep wonderfully unique places alive over here!"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Joshua B.","Gave this place 3 tries and each time was a reoccurring theme of poor service, mediocre food and a lack luster experience.
Tonight, we had made reservations a week in advance. We had to wait 20 minutes for our table and the table was one of the worst tables in the restaurant. Why make a reservation in advance if this is what happens? No apologies whatsoever from the staff.
Very unimpressive wine list. Whiskey list was worse. They don't carry local products. Staff are a mix of friendly and super rude. Hostess, rude. Lounge server, rude. Table server, super nice. So, a mixed bag of folks.
Food is decent, not great. Its as loud as a bar on game day, it's deafening.
Won't be returning anytime soon. Much better places on the Eastside."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Mark J.","Como is a good idea in a good location with great service but mediocre food, small portions, and high prices.
Each dish we had was too salty - including the salad.
The menu is also pretty small.
If you're looking for a good view, this place fits the bill. But if you're looking for good Italian food, go somewhere else."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Emily H.","Let me preface my review by saying I recently returned from Italy, so my bar for Como's food was pretty high. I also read some of the other reviews and I think my experience aligned with what many others have said: the food is really good but they need to work out the kinks. Our restaurant week Burratta appetizer was delicious! I'm a huge fan of burratta and the crostini and pickled peppers were great accompaniments. The short ribs were cooked well, but the polenta was a bit grainy. Honestly, my friend got the sweet potato gnocchi and it was amazing! If I come back I'm definitely getting that! Dessert was hazelnut and caramel gelato and I have absolutely no complaints there!
There's just some things they need to iron out in terms of the service. Our waiter was fantastic! It just took longer than expected to get our food. If they want to stay true to the Italian vibe and have slower/longer dinner service that's totally fine, but several tables (same size) that sat down after us got their food before we did. And when our food did come, we only got 2/3 dishes. Our other friend had to wait an awkward amount of time for the third dish and we didn't want to eat without her. Then, one of the other waitresses tried to give her dish to 3 other tables before i called her over and said the food was for us. It's not a huge deal, but it's also not that difficult to fix.
I have high hopes for this place! It's unique and would be a great date spot in the future."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","David P.","Had a client dinner tonight and it was interesting
The burrata was ok But the bread was like eating 2x4 so hard and stale :( ordered the short ribs and they came out cold :( client said carbonara was ok a little bland aNd cold should of gone to Cafe Jaunita :("
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Mark L.","I am not sure how to feel about this place.
The ambience is really great. The restaurant is well designed and the view is perfect on a summer day.
Service is OK....not great by any means...just OK
Cocktails....not wow at all.....just ok.
Food is pretty good, again not mind blowing but good.
I probably could have done four stars if it weren't for the following:
Service was average at best.
Food was good but for the price I would expect more.
The big one for me.....Being in the wine industry....There is obviously no training on how to care for the wine. The absolutely shocking amount of wine that ended up on the table in drips was bad enough.....the fact that there was no effort to wipe up all the drips was bordering on unforgivable. This comes down to the simple issue of training your staff. Had the slightest effort been put forward to train your staff how to pour, this would never be an issue.
Also, it seems like there might be some age discrimination here. Went with my mother who is 80 and they walked us by a number of prime seats and sat us towards the back. I noticed several other ""older"" patrons who were sat in the same area. The front was filled with the ""young and hip"" Kirkland diners. Give me a break. I get it, you want to think you are attracting people in with a certain image, but Ef you. I made a reservation early, give me a better seat than the many walk ins you had that night."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Ryan G.","Como has serious potential, but needs to make some fixes to make it awesome. Our experience had some 5-star and 1-star moments! The view is outstanding - we had a reservation for 4 and were seated on a window table. The noise is very loud, to the point where you need to shout across the table - they need to fix this.
Our friends were running late, so we ordered some cocktails and Focaccia bread while we waited. Our friends were tardier than normal, so we then ordered the Burrata appetizer. It needed some crackers, and here's where things went south. There was a bearded guy cruising the restaurant as some kind of floater. My wife said, ""Don't ask him - he seems grouchy."" I disregarded and flagged him down to ask for some crackers. He then proceeded to gruffly tell me that my guests were ""45 minutes late and we were way behind schedule. When are they arriving."" I asked if they had a reservation after us, which of course they didn't. He briskly left the table and brought me the crackers I asked for.
Our friends showed, and we enjoyed some amazing food... we loved our server - he was patient and gracious...we enjoyed the Bistecca and Risotto as mains - perfectly cooked and full of flavor.
However, I was so mad that I couldn't help myself - had to talk to someone in charge... I went to reception desk and found the main guy - asked who the guy with beard was... turns out he is the GENERAL MANAGER... I told him that make our experience even worse. I was furious- our group is about to spend $250-$300 for dinner and he's hassling me about my friends being late?! NOT a great impression for our first visit.
This gentleman at the desk was gracious, said that was not acceptable, and we were offered free dessert (which was delicious). I hope to give COMO another chance, but they are not off to a great start in my book."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Alexa D.","I had a great time at Como! My friend and I went for Seattle Restaurant week without a reservation and were greeted by the owner, who was very kind and developed a fun rapport with us throughout the evening. There were no tables available, but he ended up adapting the bar area so that we could sit in open seating and still give us a sunset view. It was stunning.
I tried the burrata, risotto, and finished off with sorbet. All were really good and comforting. Great portion sizes too- it's rare to find something like this that tastes authentic but has a large enough serving size to need a box for leftovers.
The vibe of the restaurant is trendy yet inviting- I would be comfortable taking my parents there or bringing a first date. Gorgeous setting, friendly waitstaff, and a phenomenal wine list. Definitely worth a try on your next date night."

Our server was wonderful, attentive, and knew the menu like the back of his hand ( I wish that I remembered his name for a shoutout, he was very tall!). We ordered the pappardelle and the bistecca alla lombarda to share and both were delicious. We actually started our meal with the focaccia and verdura alla griglia (sautéed veggie medley) and both were also delicious! Having just returned from Italy a month ago, I was looking forward to an aperol spritz and it did not disappoint. We ended our meal with affogato which was unique as it was chocolate and vanilla topped with pistachio. It was great!
The interior is really pretty, fresh and well designed, however it was VERY loud inside. This may be good for larger groups. We will definitely be back again!"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Edward S.","This review echos some others. Como has excellent potential, but is not quite fully functioning yet.
The location is incredible and they did a nice job on the remodel. The view is stunning to the point where the food would not matter--but the food happens to be excellent.
The problem is the service. Our server was pleasant enough, but just clearly overwhelmed and every step of meal was slow and rushed. Given the prices, they really need to hire more staff.
The wine selection is good. I started with the burrata and then then clams. The burrata was a little unusual in that it came with melon, but this turned out to be an incredible combination, particularly on a warm night. The burrata itself was perfect. The clams were really good also (and came with some sausage mixed in which I always like).
For the main dish I had the fennel sausage risotto. It was excellent, just the right amount of cheese and flavored perfectly.
For dessert, I had the cannoli. This was also outstanding-the shell was perfect and the filling was delicious.
Hopefully they will fix the service issues."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Lynden L.","I wanted to love Como more, but only a few things really stood out while others fell fairly flat. First, we made reservations quite ahead of time and resorted to a very early booking because it was the only opening, however, we noticed that even after we finished dining, the restaurant wasn't very full at all. (So definitely book earlier than later!)
The restaurant atmosphere itself is lovely. Great decor and plenty of natural light! Definitely a great place to get together with a group of friends. We loved having a view of the water (although the sun did start to blind our eyes a bit as it began to set).
We ordered a variety of dishes and cocktails to share amongst our party of 5:
The Cocktails:
- Monkey on My Back: aka a very standard gin & tonic, not notable
- Aperol Spritz: an italian classic, can't go wrong
- Thanks Jim, Pimm: on the drier side, good for those who dislike sweet cocktails
- Sample of the Sun: a bit tart, but great if you love grapefruit
- The Deep: very similar to an old fashioned, but substitutes lemon in place of orange
The Food:
- Foccacia: Probably one of the WORST Foccacia breads I've ever had. It was dry, lacking any herb/olive oil flavor, and tasted closer to stale white bread than real foccacia in regards to both flavor and texture. Definitely stay away from this one! (I always trust Il Corvo for my Foccacia bread fix!)
- Burrata: Overall, this was by far the best thing we had! The burrata was SO unbelievably fresh and milky. Never would I have thought burrata would go so well with honeydew and cantaloupe!
- Grilled Octopus: Super flavorful, but the texture was very tough to chew. The parsley and chickpea hummus were great accompaniments, but the chewy octopus made this dish disappointing.
- Squash Blossom Pizza: I liked the crust which was perfectly balanced between crunch and chew, and the pizza itself was not greasy, but the flavor was just missing some 'oomph'. Perhaps the sauce could use some more herbs.
- Casoncelli Alla Bergamasca: The filling was rather dry, and tasted like ground salame, but the sauce was pretty creamy to balance it out. But with only 6 pieces, the portion size was definitely on the smaller side.
- Dungeness Crab Risotto: Decent portion size and perfectly cooked texture, but I longed for the crab and meyer lemon flavor to be stronger.
All in all, the prices weren't terrible given the location and atmosphere, but we were definitely not impressed by the food or drinks and will unlikely find our way back here!"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Kay C.","Super hyped, and we got a reservation on opening weekend with a group so came to try.
Overall - decent Italian food but definitely felt overpriced and very small portions. In order to leave full, be prepared to spend a lot.
The restaurant had a very Miami / Greece kinda vibe with people dressed to the nines and white walls, etc.
The best part of the restaurant is the view for sure. On a nice summer day, this is the place to be but we all know those are far and few between here!"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Hazel S.","I've never written such a low review. I really wanted to like this place. The location and the restaurant itself is beautiful, but the food.... The food was completely over salted and we couldn't finish our meals. It was extremely loud and had to scream to hear each other talk. Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Philippe D.","A new restaurant is always an attraction. Was looking forward to a good Italian place. The setting looks like a Mediterranean place, builder in stone with white walls like in Greece, which is nice. However what jumped at you when you enter is the tremendous noise. Those empty walls make the conversation sound bounce back. Impossible to have a conversation without raising your voice, then more noise. Not pleasant! Maybe in the summer when the windows are open, it may be less. Or they need to cover the walls will big pictures or wall rugs. Service was good but a little slow. The food was ok but not exceptional. Want to give them another chance in the future but there are improvements possible"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Megan G.","I would rate this 3.5 if I could. We came for restaurant week tonight. First, they don't have hardly any good decent price wine. Typically I can find a good bottle for $38-$42. Here the only red for under $50 is a Chianti so that was disappointing to start. For our food I got the arugula salad which was recommended by the waiter. It was just arugula and figs which would be great except there were only 3 TINY slices of fig. It was a really sad salad. My friend got the burrata and luckily she shared because it was fantastic and way better. I had the pappardelli and she had the cheese pizza. Both were wonderful. For dessert she had gelato and I had tiramisu, both great. I loved the vibe of the restaurant and the view. Didn't love my salad. Our waiter was okay, not too friendly. I would come back but probably just for happy hour"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Jen H.","You come to Como for the spectacular view and ambiance. The restaurant is very bright with lots of windows. They have a good wine selection and of course, aperol spritz. The food was decent but a bit on the pricey end. Good place to bring date or come for happy hour."
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Brad R.","A nice little Italian spot that offers great views, fresh Italian pasta, good drinks and a diverse menu which has options for all Italian lovers. Had the gnocchi the first time which was exceptional and the second time had a pizza which was also tasty. Drink wise they have full bar and wine/beer with micro brews and deep wine selection. The place is right on the water so the view is amazing and the staff were knowledgeable and helpful. Worth a visit. Price wise was probably high two $$. Low teens and twenties for entrees."

"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Mcbeth M.","The manager is so rude. His breath stinks. And he has no sort of elegant customer service in such a wannabe southern Italian restaurant. The atmosphere does not even catch a vibe.
This is an updated review by the way, from 5 stars, and it only seems like this restaurant is going down hill. Out of half the menu when we last went in
Oh and let me mention, they didn't even have coffee.... at an Italian restaurant!!! Skip your dinner and try another spot in town. Not with it here"
"Como","https://www.yelp.com/biz/como-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Tori Z.","Yummy food and beautiful view but not the best service or ambiance. The worst part was how loud the restaurant gets, the noise bounces off the walls and makes it impossible to hear others at your table or the sever. Perhaps we were there on a noisy day but it was awful and way too loud for a nice Italian restaurant."
"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Heather W.","[I wrote this review 2.5years ago but apparently saved it as a draft and it never posted]
I am 2 months into a streak of eating out every day worth over a month left to go due to kitchen repairs from flooding. Food has lost its joy. Every meal feels the same now.
But I just had Sebi's Bistro delivered to my house and I am in AWE. I woke from a nap after a stressful day of work and an oncoming migraine to a delivery of perogi - half meat, half potato. The meat were good, the borsht was good, but the potato? Honestly, they're on my top 10 foods I've ordered during this whole fiasco. They are fluffy and creamy and tangy and comforting and nothing I could say here would sing their praises high enough.
I cannot wait to try the rest of their menu and to get these perogi fresh in their restaurant. I'm in love."
"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex O.","Pesto Twist Score: 4/5
This is very good! The pretzel twist is extremely soft and doughy. It's also slightly crispy in certain areas, especially towards the end. The marinara sauce that it comes with has finely diced garlic. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little bit more of that delicious pesto sauce.
Gypsy Stew Score: 3.5/5
I had really high expectations for this one. The beef stew comes with a side of sauerkraut and potatoe pancakes. The stew had way to much salt and the pancakes were burnt to a crisp. If they fixed those two problems this dish would probably be a 4.5/5. Overall, it was not bad and I really enjoyed it.
Cheese Crepes Score: 4.5/5
Wow! This was heavenly. I am definitely getting this one again! The cheese was nice and warm and had a hint of sweetness. It is drenched with strawberry syrup, fresh fruits, and whipped cream."

"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Inshiya V.","If you're looking for something different, and authentic Polish, head over to Sebi's. The restaurant owner's kids, who speak Polish and are passionate about their heritage, work there and are charming.
I got the schnitzel platter. It was huge! Pierogi's of your choice (ask what fillings they have that day), chicken or pork schnitzel, sauerkraut, polish sausage, and two cabbage rolls. The cabbage rolls were the star! So juicy and tasty. Really, much better than I expected to be. Everything tasted great though. Schnitzel was juicy and hot, Pierogi was generously filled, and the sausage was packed with flavor."
"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wen W.","This was my first time trying German / Polish food, really. I thought Leavenworth was where I'd only find German food, but i was wrong. The funny thing is I passed by this restaurant so many times when I still attended the U.W., but I never bothered to stop by. I guess it was finally time for me to check it out after my friend invited me to a Polish dinner with her group of friends.
I ordered a platter of Polish Kielbasa with Sauerkraut and roasted potatoes. The meal was good and satisfied my appetite. When I tried the potato dumpling from my friends' dishes, those dumplings were quite fulfilling. I guess if you are ready for a big appetite, that's what you should order. For me, the kielbasa plate was enough to handle.
Good service and OK parking - perhaps I went on a Thursday, so I didn't see any issues."
"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jon H.","Sebi's is definitely worth going out of your way for. We went in for a birthday dinner recently and the experience could not have been better! It's a quiet and intimate restaurant with a lot of charm. Great for a low key date night. Service was really attentive and personable and our food was excellent! The pierogis to start were the best I've had in the city. I ordered the beef gypsy stew with potato pancakes (available only on Fridays and Saturdays) and I'd strongly recommend trying this dish. Selfishly the only downside to Sebi's is they're closed on Sundays, like many places around Lake Union. Other than that zero complaints and I look forward to a repeat visit soon!"
"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Vivian H.","Came here for dinner one night. I'd had this place bookmarked for SOOO long. We got the polish platter and beef stew over potato pancakes. We also got the pretzel covered cheese bites and stuffed clams.
The pretzel bites came out first and they were essentially fried dough stuffed with cheese with a beer cheese sauce. It was delicious (how could it not be?), but they weren't pretzel bites at all (you know, the baked, buttery kind with big salt crystals), which was what we were expecting.
The stuffed clams were OK. They were mostly cheese.
The polish platter came with a stuff cabbage roll, kielbasa, and pierogis. The menu didn't say what kind of pierogis they'd be. They turned out to be cheese pierogis and I really wanted meat pierogies. My fault, I should have asked. The stuff cabbage roll was OK but my husband loved it. The kielbasa and the accompanying mustard was good.
The beef stew was served over potato pancakes and it would've been so much better if the stew wasn't completely soaking the pancakes, turning them into mush. I did manage to get a tiny crispy edge. The beef was tough and flavorless. There won't be a next time, but if there were, I'd ask for the stew to be served on the side, or at least covering only half the pancakes like I see in other photos. We brought half of this home but ended up not eating it.
Overall, I was disappointed and I think I will just get my pierogi fix at Pel Meni."

They have a great selection of tasty eastern European beers and polish vodkas.
I'll be back!"

Went here with my fiancé and we got Pan fired pierogis as an appetizer, and were very happy with it. We also got really good beer based on our servers recommendations, and schnitzel for dinner. Everything was delicious.
It was a Saturday so they were a bit busy so service was slower than expected but since we had good beer and great food we didn't mind.
Will come here again and again whenever I'm craving German or polish food (which is often)"

Perfectly delicious Polish home cooking and Polish beer on tab. We had dinner there for the first time and it will not be the last time. We had the Jäger Schnitzel in Mushroom sauce with small home made potato dumplings. Once you had those small bite size potato dumplings you will wonder why you ever thoughts gnocchi are any good. The Schnitzel was very good as well. I had the Polish plate with grilled Kielbasa. The good news is it was super tasty, the bad news is it will ruin your desire to buy another Kielbasa at your local super market for a long time to come. The service and bar is manned by the owners sons, Daniel and his brother. Daniel really took care of us, my permanent liver damage is testimony of that. As said...you will like it."

"Sebi’s Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thomas R.","Deliciously savory stuffed cabbage rolls (like your Polish grandmother used to make) are the stars of the menu here.
We had only planned to have a couple of Polish beers at the bar, but after sampling the clam appetizer, we stayed put for dinner. Their hunky barman suggested the cabbage rolls, and man, was he right. I licked the plate those Gołąbki were served on. I dreamt about them later that night. Pure heaven.
What a delight this place is! I can't wait to go back, especially for a cup of that amazing borscht. The succulent magenta broth was so tasty, and the pieces of whole beet at the bottom made for a pleasant surprise. Next time, I'm going to order a bowl of it (or a gallon if they'll let me).

Borscht: sweet and clean-tasting, felt healthy and made my tummy feel good. Been dreaming of it ever since.
Fried pierogis: YUM! Came with sour cream and sauerkraut on the side. I was sad when the server took away the plate that still had a glob of sour cream on it, but I didn't want him to think I was a pig, so I didn't say anything. We ate them as an appetizer, but next time I might get as the main.
Cabbage rolls: a delicate, melting layer of cabbage gently enfolds a mound of fragrant rice and ground meat. The whole thing is smothered in a creamy, tangy tomato sauce.
Blueberry dumplings: basically a blueberry pierogi. Pushing the carbs, but they were delicious, so who cares? I liked that they weren't super sweet.
For the amount of food we consumed, I found the bill to be quite reasonable. Elegant ambiance, with white tablecloths. I am going back and bringing my mother for her birthday dinner next week."

"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa J.","I really wanted to love this place but it the absolute worst Italian place I have ever been to. Horrible food that was cheap quality, super loud inside, and just not a good experience.
My boyfriend's dish was what made me give this place 1 Star. He ordered the pork jowls and mushroom pasta, but it turned out to be a nasty PASTA SOUP covered in bacon grease and fat... only a few tiny mushrooms and very soggy bacon strips. I had a taste too and it tastes like top ramen noodles covered in grease with no flavor at all....I was shocked to see a restaurant serve this. My boyfriend is not a picky eater at all and he couldn't even stomach this.
I ordered the eggplant pouches for my main dish. It was lukewarm in the center of the dish, which makes me wonder when and how it was prepared. The ravioli pouches weren't boiled all the way and very very al dente... and it was covered with cheap rubbery Parmesan cheese (not even real parmigiano) and the tomato sauce had no taste. This meal just tasted very cheap and lacked quality.
Our waiter left us sitting with the unfinished food for 30 minutes and never once asked how our food was. He asked if we want a box and brought us the bill. I didn't want to complain but I spoke up and told him that we couldnt even finish our food because it was inedible. He seemed nice about it but kept claiming that the mushroom and pork jowl pasta dish was his favorite and it's popular at the restaurant..."
"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Abdullah A.","I was taken here for an impromptu dinner. Launching into the three course meal, I started with the polenta with wild mushroom and wine sauce. The mushrooms and wine were able to harmoniously mix their unique flavors, which were balanced but distinct. The polenta was soft and provided its characteristic subtly gritty texture. It was completely bathed in sauce, which I always appreciate.
A wild boar sacrificed its juicy tenderloins for the main course. It was sliced into double-bite-sized pieces with a creamy and thick mustard gorgonzola sauce, whose sum was much less in-your-face than its parts. The pork was accompanied by baked fingerling potatoes and roasted kale and squash. Retrospectively, I might have ordered it medium rather than medium rare.
The lemon and mascarpone dessert resembled a panna cotta. It was topped with blueberries and raspberries to add some welcome tartness, making the dish overall sweet but not too rich.
The atmosphere was upscale but nothing special. The service was very attentive, bordering on hovering. The location is prime. And the price is what you would expect, about $60 per person after tax and tip. Not exactly my scene, but it accomplishes its goal well."

Had a lovely dinner with my parents and hubby here. The ragu was rich and flavorful, and it reminded me of the ragu I have had in Italy. I personally find the Puttanesca a little too salty because the chef put a generous amount of capers and olive; I did enjoy that tomato sauce though. The crab ravioli was a little disappointing - there were lots of crabs but the tomato cream sauce overwhelmed the crab. The clams was fresh and light but flavorful. All the pasta were cooked perfectly. Our server was friendly and helpful in accommodating all the dietary restriction at our table. I would definitely recommend this place!"

The ambiance is casual and like many popular restaurants the tables are close together. They have a really nice wine list. Service was outstanding throughout the meal.
I started with the clams. This was really delicious. It came with spicy sausage and was in a nice tomato broth. The bread they provide is good and works very well to soak up the delicious sauce.
For the main course I had the lobster risotto. This was good and came with a generous portion of lobster that was mixed in."
"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Justin C.","If you come on a full night guaranteed you'll be shouting to hear your partner, and even the servers get in on it too to best speak to you. The tables are a little crammed together but if you don't come during Seattle Restaurant Week maybe your ears won't be ringing afterwards. That being said the dining room has a nice interior and location is along a strolling row of shops and restaurants in downtown Kirkland. The appetizers and red meat entrées are amazing. I think it's their attention to sauces that really sets Volterra apart from other New American places for me. Didn't try their pasta after reading other reviews (I'm also trying to carb down too). Both of the desserts lacked a little bit in sweetness/texture that I would've found good to have after devouring the beef tenderloin and some wild boar but they balance each other out so we went back and forth between the tiramisu and chocolate cake. Great date spot and you can easily walk around afterwards and hop to another place without driving."

"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Syed A.","Made a reservation on Opentable for Valentine's day. 3-4 hours before we show up, I get a call from the restaurant saying they need my credit card info to keep the reservation and they'll charge $25 if we don't show up. I would've have appreciated if I was informed before making the reservation, but not a big deal.
When we showed up, another surprise, regular menu is not available, instead 'Valentines day special' menu is the only option for $75 per person. We ended up with a bill of around $250 by the time we were done. Spending that much on dining on a special occasion is not a problem but it wasn't an informed decision, I felt like it was a trap. The lady who called for credit card info few hours before we showed up, should've mentioned that they are not serving from the regular menu.
Even though food was alright, I won't visit this restaurant again because of their shady behavior."
"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Evan Y.","Fantastic pasta and service. We ordered one salad and two pastas, and they set the salad into two plates so that it is easier to us to share, which is pretty sweet. They also sincerely asked how we were and how the foods were.
The crab pasta is awesome that it was full of crab meat inside; and the pork jowl and wild mushroom pasta is as well as great that the table also told us that is their favorite dish. However, if you are not a crazy truffle fun, you might feel it is too strong that you might get sick of it after finishing it.
We went at late night and the environment is pretty romantic. Parking was also easy to find, and there should be a few public parking that you could walk to."

"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Anthony T.","Honestly the only thing stopping me from coming here again and again is my small wallet and the semi high prices. My first time here I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food they gave and that's never something I'll complain about.
I personally ordered the lobster risotto and it had meat from an entire lobster in it! The flavors were well rounded and I found everything about the entree to be delectable. My father ordered the steak salad and loved every bite; even the salad and he doesn't even like vegetables! My sister ordered the thin spaghetti with prawns and she found the flavors to be incredible. She really enjoyed her entree as it wasn't too salty and she could taste the seafood flavors vividly.
Another thing to take note of is that they offer complimentary bread. Normally I'm not a fan of free bread as I feel it's cheap and filler but the ones here were quite good! They did not judge or question me when I asked for refills 5+ times and I think that's an excellent trait for servers to have.

Honestly, this is a constant go-to spot in downtown Kirkland I often frequent. I have been here multiple times to celebrate birthdays, work promotions, and so much more... I thought this would be a continuous late night spot and the best place downtown Kirkland to enjoy some pasta. Little did I know, this would change.
I gave this place a 2-star review only because of the manager. If I rated on food only, this would be a 4-star review. The pasta is pretty good and most things I have had here are worth the trip.
...the manager is horrible. I thought the first experience was a fluke, I came here for a friend's birthday (made reservations) and called ahead to let them know a couple extra people could join. I was given a warning there was no more space for any additions after these few were added. I understood. When I arrived, someone had brought their significant other (out of my control) and was berated that I was pre-warned about bringing anybody else. I literally thought I was getting a lecture from my mother. We politely explained we are a loving group and are okay squeezing an extra person in. Since the restaurant was packed, I overlooked this thinking it was a one-time thing. Then, I came in recently to have some food and drinks at the bar, something casual. The restaurant was slow and not even half full. When we came in the manager asked: ""Do you have reservations,"" as we walked to the bar. ""No, we are meeting a friend at the bar."" The manager looked confused and concerned and swiftly went to the bartender to ask if it she was okay serving us without reservations. We later double checked if you need reservations to simply sit at the bar, and the answer was of course, NO. The way she handled the situation seemed as if she was bothered by our presence and we did not feel welcomed, even to the point where I did not want to order food. I was talked into staying and after a ~$200 meal it was time to leave. I left with my partner and we received a sly smile as we walked out - almost like she was thankfully we were leaving. Of course, my friend was right behind us and she received a warm and thoughtful salutation.
After we left, I received multiple questions on the way the manager treated us and why we were singled out. For that I am not sure, I am not one to jump to conclusions, but even someone in our party asked if she was prejudice (since everyone else was treated with respect). I am not one to leave negative reviews, but I can think of no other alternative to express my concern and disinterest in the place that I once valued."
"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Julie D.","Went for Seattle Restaurant Week. Menu options were fewer than the regular tasting menu, but food was good. The Boar tenderloin had good flavor and the sauce was delicious. The Lamb shank was also good, yet somewhat bland, could use more flavor/seasoning. Crab Ravioli was very good and the pasta tasted fresh made. Oil soup was also very good. Tiramisu was light and flavorful without a strong coffee taste. Fruit cobbler was good and did not taste sugary. Great deal. Would return.
My only complaint is that the tables are too close together and they seated someone right next to us when there were many other open tables. We felt like we went to dinner with another couple, when we did not. Our waiter was very good. Would recommend."
"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","B X.","I love this place! One of my favorite restaurants in Kirkland. Yesterday I came right before happy hour, so was able to do the half pasta, half salad and 2 glasses of wine. Not much to say about the salad since it was a caesar, the pasta was a spicy sausage pasta with a thicker noodle. The pasta was okay. I got the Lobster Ravioli and felt like that one was kind of flavorless, but there was a good amount of lobster in each ravioli. The sauce was lacking. The real star of the show as our main entree, the tagliatelle bolognese. The meat sauce was super flavorful and went great with the ribbon tagliatelle pasta. I would come back just for this entree as it blew everything else out of the water! Overall, good dining experience and great service."
"Volterra","https://www.yelp.com/biz/volterra-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Mark N.","Went here for the first time for Valentine's Day dinner. I had seafood appetizer (Dungeness crab cab) and main course (scallops) which were good, the scallops especially. My wife had vegetarian options, and the mushroom risotto was visually very unappealing. Tasted OK but not great - the consistency was way too dry and the rice wasn't creamy. Pasta second course was very sweet and under-salted, without much flavor in the gorgonzola sauce.
Overall, pretty disappointing. And based on the price ($275 for 2 people, with one glass of wine) it should have been much better."

We arrived a little early and had some happy hour in the bar, prior to our friends joining us for dinner.
Everything was just as we remembered. Divine!
Our two servers Steven & Allison were superb!
Both very knowledgeable and passionate about their jobs! The hostess, although we did not get her name made a great first impression! She had a great attitude, and helped us transition from a two person hi top to a 4 person table in the bar. The atmosphere and vibe was great! Can't wait to go back!"

We were a group of 7 with a reservation at 7.45 pm but we finally got a table at 8 ish. They have no waiting area. So we had to cramp up near the door as it was cold and raining outside. The ambiance is amazing! Would be perfect for a nice date. Decor is antique and classy. The crowd is Bellevue crowd so expect to see everyone dressed fancy. Service was good not great. We had to ask for bread and no one asked us for fresh ground pepper on our pastas.
We tried their burrata plate and arancini as appetizers. Loved the burrata plate! The cheese is creamy and is perfectly balanced by the sweet onion relish! Flavor, texture, presentation - ticks all 3. The arancini on the other hand I don't think I'll get again. Nothing great about that one. All of us got pasta. I got their rigatoni. I found it a tad too tough! I understand al dente but this was more tough than I would like. The veal ragu it came with was tasty. I got to try the other pastas as well. Really liked their gnocchi and pappardelle. For desert we got their tiramisu, lemon panacotta and zepolle which are fried donut balls with Nutella. Would highly recommend the zepolle and tiramisu. The lemon panna cotta wasn't lemony enough for me, awesome texture though!
They do charge 20% gratuity for large groups. We had a really enjoyable evening with nice wine and food. Overall definitely worth another visit!"

On a whim 3 of decided to stop in for dinner on a Thursday night. Hoping it wasn't going to be busy. We were wrong about that. Host/Manager was saying no tables until 8 pm but if we wanted to sit at the bar we can. There was two seats but he asked some guests to move move two chairs so we could be accommodated at the bar. Very nice of them. The place was full.
Food looked great like last time and came out quick. The ribeye steak was perfect! Pastas are made in house, however my two friends pasta texture/bite was good BUT it was TOO salty:( Kevin, the bartender, was very friendly and quick on refilling our hot waters. Servers were nice.
In the future, I will be back, hopefully next time will not be salty."
"Cantinetta Bellevue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-bellevue-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Emily J.","The perfect date night spot. I think the decor is maybe farmhouse chic? Whatever it is, is modern, trendy, dim lighting during dinner, cozy intimate vibes.
The menu here is very small. If you are a picky eater, you need to take a look at the menu before you go and hope that you find a recent picture of one. I am not sure how often it changes but it is definitely not the same for a long time, maybe seasonal? Ask the restaurant if you are concerned.
The servers are very friendly and nice. They know their recommendations if you ask for one and even though busy, come to check on you.
It has been a few months since I ate here but I have been here multiple times. Even though the menu changes, it is consistent. The food is cooked perfectly, the flavors aren't just your average meal, this place really serves an experience. You will have a good time going here with people you enjoy spending time with. Maybe even a business dinner if you need a nice small place to go."

The burrata appetizer was tasty (better with table bread than hard baked bread), the short rib was great, the carbanara was very rich and creamy and the tiramisu was excellent. I would have given this 5 stars if the ventilation wasn't so terrible. While at your table, it feels like you are right in the kitchen and at the end of the night your clothes smell like they were next to the grill. They have to figure out a way to have better ventilation in there."

"Cantinetta Bellevue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-bellevue-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","James N.","It was alright but not outstanding. The menu is very limited and so is the street parking around the restaurant. Surprised there is no parking lot or valet. Overall, prices were on a higher side for what you get. The atmosphere is cozy like a neighborhood restaurant.
As for the food, it was fine but not spectacular. The arugula salad with pistachio vinaigrette was good but not worthy of the price given it was literally just arugula and dressing with a few pieces of dried fruit on top. Brussel sprouts were okay but could've used a hint of salt, but the waitress wasn't around at the time so I could ask - although I will say that the service overall was fine. My main dish was the salmon which was the fish of the day. I was surprised how perfectly this was cooked. Definitely the star of the show. I also tried the sausage pasta dish and was underwhelmed. For an Italian restaurant that supposedly makes their pasta in house daily, I found the dish fairly mediocre.
I toyed between three and four stars but ultimately gave it four stars because there was a cute hostess that also helped serve us. While she wasn't our main waitress, I wish that she was because she was very friendly and cute, she had a great energy to her. Having energetic, friendly, attractive, happy service staff is huge and I feel like this is undervalued by a lot of restaurants these days, but definitely shouldn't be overlooked. Not only did she make the dining experience better, but she also earned this review the extra star."

From the moment we walked in I felt like I was walking into a friends home for dinner. The service was spot on, attentive when needed offering suggestions and gave us space to enjoy our meal and conversation. We started with the antipasto tray that had a great variety of meats, cheeses, nut, olives, honey comb and toasted bread. For the next course we had the pappardelle with meat sauce and the gnocchi with sausage and pear. All I can say is melt in your mouth awesome, so good. The next course we had short ribs with the Broccolini. Just when you thought the meal couldn't possible get any better, it did! The short ribs were so tender with great flavor and the Broccolini was perfectly al dente with a nice garlic flavor. Even though we were so full we could of rolled out of there we had to try the Zeppole with Mascarpone and chocolate sauce. Guess what it was one of the best Zeppoles I've ever had! This is a must try restaurant."

Our waitress was one of the best I have had in a while - perfect combo of friendly, knowledgeable, and super-attentive (without being overbearing). Now the food:
Cocktails: The Cantinetta Manhattan was incredible - whatever magic sauce they put in there was genius (the port?). My wife enjoyed a gin cocktail that I can't remember, since I was engrossed with the Manhattan...
Contori: House-made Focaccia in olive oil & balsamic... mmm
Antipasti: Burrata - I had never heard of this, but will be on the lookout again. Fresh mozzarella injected with cream, served with tomatoes and toasted bread. The burrata melts in your mouth, and flavor combo's were delicious.
Primi: We went with two from this section - the Risotto & Bolognese. Holy cow the flavors were bursting from the plate... so... much... flavor... enough said.
Decided against dessert since we were so full, but the donuts were tempting. We will be back."

"Cantinetta Bellevue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-bellevue-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Liz S.","Tasty Italian inspired food with a pleasant atmosphere and adequate service.
My party of 5 made a reservation for a table at 6 on a sunny Tuesday evening. When we arrived, only a few other tables were occupied, but by the time we left the medium-sized restaurant was nearly full.
For drinks I ordered a gin martini with a lemon twist. The bartender also added a cucumber slice garnish which was a nice touch. The martini was good. I've have a couple slightly better martinis before but no complaints.
Our table got a couple plates of bread served with olive oil and balsamic to snack on while we waited for our main dishes to arrive. I tried the focaccia and the baguette. Both were fresh. I might prefer the focaccia a bit more, but would happily nosh on either. (We were asked if we wanted bread for our table... you might have to pay for it--it is listed on the menu for $3.5--but I'm not 100% sure.)
A few insalata mistas were ordered at my table so I had some bites of that ($9). The salad consisted of mixed greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. The amount of dressing was perfect and the greens were fresh.
For the main course I ordered the vegetarian cheese stuffed ravioli served with tomato sauce, morel mushrooms, a smattering of chopped asparagus, and sprouts?? (I think this dish was around $22.) The plating was pretty and the dish was flavorful and fresh tasting. Bright for a ravioli dish, and not too heavy or cheesy. The serving size is not big, so be sure to order a salad and bread if you're not a light eater. I also had a few bites of the seasonal vegetarian risotto ($21). The risotto was very flavorful as well. It included nettles (mixed throughout), lemon, and Parmesan. Don't let the nettles deter you, it looks more like a pesto was stirred into the risotto. The risotto is on the looser end of the spectrum... not as plump and thick as other risottos that I've had before but it was still delicious. A couple people at my table actually liked the looser aspect.
The restaurant interior is nice but casual, and the big windows facing the street open up, which is ideal on warm days. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, recommending the ravioli and risotto for vegetarian mains. They do have quite a few vegetarian options, all noted on the menu with a little star.
Overall I'd be happy to come back again."

Honestly needed the waiter to interpret the complex items on the menu - definitely different than your standard run-of-the-mill Italian selections! We chose a few dishes as ""appetizers"" - the beet salad, veal meatballs, and spicy rigatoni were the best - and had the tenderloin and rigatoni for mains. Everyone enjoyed the food. Shared several of the desserts - the panna cotta was lovely!"
"Cantinetta Bellevue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-bellevue-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Forrest T.","Cantinetta is a pleasant Italian restaurant right on Main Street in Old Downtown Bellevue and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
As always, parking in this area is tough. You can try your luck with street parking, but it may be worthwhile to just park at Bellevue Square mall and walk the 3-4 blocks to the restaurant. Decor on the inside is clean and sparse, with soft lighting and lots of wine bottles everywhere. Service was excellent and friendly; our server did a great job handling our table of 10 people. Wine selection is very, very good, but if you're a beer drinker just be aware that this restaurant only carries a few beers. Probably a space constraint. Noise level was low when I first arrived for an early dinner, but as the restaurant got more crowded, it got louder.
The food was great. For an appetizer I tried the meatballs, which were small but well made with a standout red sauce, bright and flavorful. My main course was a fresh caught salmon special that came out a touch overcooked but with delicious seasonings and a nice buttery sauce and veggies on the side.
Overall, I'd come back to Cantinetta for a nice business dinner, a casual date, or a delicious meal with friends, and look forward to returning."

I recommend sticking with pasta-specifically the bolognese or ravioli. I also really like the focaccia bread with oil/balsamic and the misto salad. However I would NOT recommend ordering fish or any dish with mushrooms here. Last night I ordered the halibut special cooked in parchment and it was not pleasant. The the entire dish was lacking in flavor and the mushrooms were very gritty as if there were sand on them. So I say go somewhere else for fish and steer clear of the mushrooms, but go here to enjoy the wine, pasta, bread, salad, great atmosphere, and wonderful service."
"Cantinetta Bellevue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-bellevue-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","c c.","I gave this place another try after an underwhelming experience several years ago. I was hoping that the passage of time, more experience and a new set of staff members would bring this place to a different level -- but Cantinetta continues to be mediocre.
The restaurant lured me back with the cozy vibe that it gave off from the outside looking in. The dim lights and candles made me hope for a nice local neighborhood Italian place that we could frequent. But in reality, the dimness makes it hard to see the food right in front of you, and perhaps that was intentional.
The staff was very off-putting. The recurring theme of negative attitudes from the staff makes me wonder if there is a bigger problem with how this establishment is run. They didn't seem to enjoy working there and appeared stressed out. If you don't enjoy your job, don't take it out on well-meaning patrons. For example, the front of the house (Esther) didn't exude sincere hospitality which is what a hostess's job is, right? She was also dishonest about the reservation situation when I inquired about table availability. The server was rushed and passive aggressive and didn't know her menu. I tried to engage her with friendly comments along the way and she was too stressed out to care.
To try to end on a positive note, the food was ok (but not memorable). However, there is an Italian restaurant right around the corner that far exceeds the food and provides a kinder and much more refined experience. Thanks for reminding me why I didn't come back for years, Cantinetta. Lesson learned."

"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","J. R.","Dined here recently with a work group. We figured Italian would appeal to most tastes.
My critique is only on my food, since our group was large and I don't want to speak for anyone else there.
Overall rating? 2 stars. It was ok, but nothing to knock my socks off. On the level of a local version of Olive Garden perhaps?
Good menu selection and interesting sounding items. Service was very good considering our group size. Portions ok as was the temperature and time from order to service.
I ordered a luncheon special that had a cream sauce, sausage, mushrooms and I believe spinach. The ingredients sounded delicious. It arrived and was tasty. The pasta component was a bit too soft for me. I like it a bit more al dente.
Given our group, we all knew the 20% surcharge rule. I'm o.k. with that, and know going in. My biggest beef is that the 20% on my bill was computed on the total bill WITH sales tax.
If I'm not mistaken, I thought tips start with the food subtotal, not the total WITH sales tax. So, the tip base starts out larger when tax is included. Whether intentional or not, in my book it's not very transparent. You are automatically adding another 10% to the tipping base. Adds up over time.
Anyway, this is not one of my go-to places, having been here only once or twice before over the years. No big loss in my big dining picture. I have other favorites."

They also have a great dessert tray, which they bring to the table to tempt you with the various choices.
The bar has a great happy hour, but it gets crowded quickly. And I would avoid the ""Italchos"" which are a rather sad attempt at an Italian nacho."

I think this restaurant is one of the best Italian restaurants on the eastside.
The décor is classic upscale Italian restaurant chic. The wait staff is wonderful, attentive, professional and informed and then of course, there's the food. It's always delicious.
Last Sunday mom and I went to Grazie's.
We ordered Bruschetta with 3 spreads; olive tapenade, chopped tomatoes and a truly delicious (was it freshly made?) ricotta. We each had salad. Me, a small house salad, mom. a small pear gorgonzola salad. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken, capers. white wine and pine nuts, she ordered shrimp and crab cannelloni. We shared a fruit tart for dessert.
What a delicious dinner. We both agreed that the Bruschetta and a side salad would make a very good light lunch.
Grazie's is a wonderful date night restaurant, but it's also a great pizza restaurant, Italian eatery for the family restaurant, gourmet Italian take out restaurant. It's just a excellent restaurant all around."
"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Emily J.","I ate dinner here last night because we were having an event. I had a much better experience eating there than I did ordering to go. The waiters we had were very nice and accommodating to everyone questions, modifications etc. Very nice customer service when eating in the restaurant.
They also have a parking lot which makes going here convenient. There are plenty of spaces and even though it had a ton of cars in it, you would not have trouble finding a space.
As for the dining room which we did not eat in, it looked decently filled with people. The event room is off to the back corner and is nicely arranged with multiple tables, some windows for lighting, doors that cancel out the noise etc. Would I hold my event here, probably not because it is not really my style but would I recommend it to anyone looking to have a small to mid size family dinner, sure.
We had a set menu this night so the following was chosen by one of colleagues coordinating the event I imagine. I ended up trying a bite of the Dungeness Crab and Artichoke Dip, which was pretty good. I ate it without the crackers and was still a fan. The Crab and Shrimp Cannelloni looked and smelled like some really good fresh pasta and crab. For my dish, I had the Chicken Marsala. It was good but I never order that dish anywhere else so I am not really sure where it falls on the scale. I would recommend it though if you are trying to follow a certain diet routine or want a good meal of protein. The risotto which I only had one bite of was amazing. I already want to either go back for the Parmesan Risotto or try making it myself."

The salad was enough for one single person, and it consisted on pretty much a bag of arugula, about 6 cherry tomatoes, and some parmesan shavings. The pizza was regular. Sorry to say, we'll be sticking to our regulars from now on."

I had the Gorgonzola tortellini, and added roasted red pepper and roma tomatoes. The toppings that were $1.50 each, were sparse. It tasted like frozen tortellini. Wasn't anything to write home about, I'd say mediocre at best. The Gorgonzola sauce wasn't tangy or anything like I expected. My brother got the lasagna and says it's the best he's had from a restaurant, and also liked the meatballs he got. My dad rates the chicken parm as a 1. I tried it and partially agree. It tasted like one of those foster farms chicken patties with barely any marinara sauce. I think it honestly depends on what you get. The bread with garlic pesto olive oil is really good."

It was quite the memorable experience. Our server Drew was so knowledgeable when it came to ordering from their menu. His attention to detail about the wines and dinner menu shows how much he truly cares for his customers. I've never experienced the service that he provided.

"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Greg B.","I just tried this place for the first time recently and my initial impression is that it's just a step up from Olive Garden. The step up coming from the nice live smooth jazz band playing on Saturdays and a pretty decent service. Otherwise, the menu and food quality is somewhat disappointing.
First, the bread served appears to be store bought and lacks flavor. There is nothing in it that draws me to take another piece. The soup selections are only two different types of bisques. I had the garlic soup which was tasty, but I would have preferred a more authentic Italian option. I am pretty big on soups after all. Lastly, I had the tagliatelle primavera for the main course which is a wood oven grilled vegetable garlic pasta. The dish was a bit overcooked and the char flavor was overpowering. This made it difficult to eat.
Overall, I gave the place a mixed rating. I may return to try other dishes, but this won't be my go to place."

Easy to find, parking lot was large and easily accessible. Got seated right away. It looked busy, but that just might have been our area. Our waiter was really nice and went through the specials for the night. We ordered Calamari Fritti and Tortellini Fritti to start. SO Yummy! They were cooked perfectly and came out hot! Loved the dipping sauces they came with too. Then we got the Spaghettini Bolognese, Lasagna, and one of the Specials which was Salmon with a fruit salsa and risotto. The food came out right after we finished the appetizers. Nice portions, hot plates. The lasagna was really good, especially the pesto sauce. I think the Spaghettini and Salmon could of had more flavor to it."
"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Zaki R.","Best part was the service! Our server was super nice, helped us keep things sane with our small kids. Great ambiance, with a jazz trio playing in the bar. They have very thoughtfully laid out the restaurant into three distinct sections - the bar, restaurant area for couples and the family section kind of separated out. We really loved the woodwork in the ceiling.
The food was amazing as well. We started off with the bruschetta, the three spreads - tomato, ricotta, and olive were just out of this world. I'm not a big fan of olives but this tapenade was toast licking good. I had the filleto gorgonzola, which was done to perfection! The side of mashed potatoes and fried onions were surprising, I should've asked for some basic pasta instead. My wife went for the seafood fettuccine - great sauce, not so amazing seafood...but that's OK.
Great wine selection and recommendation. I'm running out of patience to keep on writing enough good things :D but don't forget to get tiramisu...
...we'll be back for sure!"

We for lunch, my coworker and I tried this place for lunch yesterday. We stood in the lobby a good 3 minutes before a waiter asked how could he help us. I responded that we wished to have lunch. After another delay, the waiter seated us with an air of frustration.
We were served water and menus, and from that point on, we were virtually IGNORED by same waiter as he set all the tables around us. (There was only 1 other party in the restaurant)
We decided to leave. The hostess, as we left, was sitting at the bar looking at her phone.
So not impressed."
"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Joni K.","Visited this establishment last Thursday for a late lunch with my 13-month twins and our nanny. It was her birthday and she wanted to celebrate with Italian food. I've been to the Southcenter location previously and really enjoyed the food (especially since they offered gluten free pasta :) ) and really appreciated their customer service. I didn't realize there was a location in Bothell until I found it via Yelp. Everyone raved about the customer service at this establishment, so we decided to celebrate there.
Upon arrival, no one was at the hostess desk but we saw workers around in the dining room and bar. After several minutes, a salt and peppered hair gentlemen in a black server uniform greeted me with ""Yes?"" I told him that we needed a table for four and requested a more secluded table. My though process for this request being: 1) the twins could be loud and I didn't want them to disturb others, and 2) the twins were born three months premature, have weak immune systems and respiratory issues so it was an attempt for me to TRY to protect them from any potential cold germs floating around. The gentlemen simply looked at me when I asked him for a more secluded table and walked away. No reply... nothing... I'm assuming when he walked away, that was our que to follow him... As we entered the dining room, he immediately walked to the first booth in the center of the dining room. I though maybe he didn't hear me when I requested a more private table, so I asked if we could sit in one of the corner booths. He gave me a look and stated that these were the booths that were being seated at the moment.
As we started unpacking our own travel high chairs, he came and tried to take our drink order. I found it really irritating as we hadn't even sat down, he saw that we were struggling to get the twins settled, and yet it seemed like he was rushing us in choosing that moment to take our drink order. After that, I'm not sure what happened, but I believe we were passed off to another server. The poor lady was also supporting the bar and coming to try to serve us as well. She wasn't the friendliest but she was sufficient. At the end, she even gave us a small smile. The best part of this experience was a man that looked like he was the manager. He helped me select a birthday dessert for our nanny and arranged for it to be delivered to us after our meal.
At 3pm, I no longer saw the original gentleman. Perhaps he was irritated with us because we arrived at 2pm and he got off at 3pm? Or maybe his lunch break was at 3pm, he was HANGRY and taking it out on us? LOL! I am not sure, but I more than likely will not be visiting this location again. It is difficult enough to pack the twins and all their ""luggage"" for an outing... but when we actually do make it out, I don't need an unfriendly face and attitude."

"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Wendy B.","I have visited this restaurant off and on since it first opened. There was a time about ten years back that the food was decent enough, this was not one of those times.
We sat at a table in the bar. We were there to hear a friend's band. A lot of jazz combos play here and we like to come here to support our friends who play here. There is no cover charge which is nice.
The first thing I noticed was how filthy the bar menu was. That immediately has me focusing on what else was wrong with the place, like the missing bulbs in the chandeliers and the way the copper colored table tops are no longer smooth.
Our server brings us dinner menus because we hadn't yet decided if we wanted a meal or snacks. Besides the bar menu being filthy none of the appetizer prices on the bar menu match the prices on the dinner menu. The bar menu has happy hour/non-happy hour pricing and the higher price on the bar menu is still lower than the price of the same appetizer on the dinner menu. I did not check our bill but for two appetizers, two beers and two cocktails, I expect we paid the higher of the three prices. I didn't see our server long enough to ask her and quite frankly the management should not have to leave it to the customer to figure it out.
We ordered the meatballs and artichoke dip appetizers. The meatballs came with what the menu called ""grilled polenta cakes"". The meatballs were lukewarm, not piping hot, they were okay and the polenta was two small triangles with black grill marks that looked more dirty than grilled and didn't taste like anything, yeah it's polenta. I am not certain what purpose they really served because they were small and there were three large meatballs. Was I supposed to eat them with bites of meatball or just dip them in the tomato sauce?
The artichoke crab dip was not my choice. It too was lukewarm, but what was really surprising, or maybe not, is that the kitchen is incapable of making toast successfully. Yep, they f***ed up TOAST!! It was two slices of dried out bread that wasn't toasted enough to support a dollop of the lukewarm crab dip! The dip was flavorless, no seasoning, and it really needs to go back to the decade it came from.
The cocktails I ordered were good, the bartender has a lot of regulars who know him by name but sometimes he talked so loudly he drowned out the combo.
We will likely be back to hear a friend's band but we're going to eat somewhere else."

I put this place up against any other dining establishment in town.

The entrees are all wonderful, I've had most of them and they are delicious. If you can't decide try the Cannelloni! It's 10 out of 10!
Cocktails here are also amazing, I love their take on the old fashioned, really high quality stuff.

"Burrata Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/burrata-bistro-poulsbo?osq=Italian+Food","Sara A.","Another fine meal at Buratta Bistro!
I am very happy to report that they have air conditioning!
I was rather surprised how dead it was on a sunny Saturday evening in July. Last year, we barely got a table and there were people being turned away. It's a real shame because this restaurant is quite delicious.
We had the pork meatballs and the burrata caprese as an appetizer. Once again, the pork meatballs reign supreme, they are the best I have ever had. The burrata salad was a little different this time, with a pistachio pesto and fresh tomatoes only. It was good. We were offered crostini on side, instead of paying $5 for the Focaccia (which I find to be too soft). It was perfect. Be sure to get the parmesan cheese when they offer it, it's exceptional and adds a lot of flavor to the already incredible meatballs.
For dinner, I had the pork piccata and it was just as spectacular as it was the last time. My husband loves Cioppino so he got that off of the specials menu. It was delicious and included an Alaskan crab leg, but they didn't say how much it cost. It turned out to be $37. I know there was a decent amount of seafood in there but it seems incredibly overpriced, and I wish that I had known in advance how much it cost because I would have dissuaded him from ordering it. Oh well, he enjoyed it.
For dessert, we shared the tiramisu. I didn't really like it that much, unfortunately. It was kind of dry and heavy on the marscapone. If they had used more espresso to soak the lady fingers, I think I would have enjoyed it more.
A minor quibble, surely. I would try the fresh Berry tart next time. I considered it but I was in the mood for tiramisu.
Overall, the service was fantastic, and we had a great evening. I definitely recommend this restaurant."

"Burrata Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/burrata-bistro-poulsbo?osq=Italian+Food","Julia S.","3.5 stars. I came here for a celebration with my friends. I had made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we got there. The restaurant was fairly full so I was happy to see the reserved sign on our table. We were greeted, given water and really yummy focaccia bread. I ordered a couple appetizers and a beverage right away as I was about to eat off my arm. The burrata caprese salad was delicious, mostly cheese and lovely cherry tomatoes with a pesto drizzle. The artichoke hearts were a little disappointing. I didn't realize they came deep fried and breaded. Maybe I should have read the menu better. For dinner we order a special, butternut squash ravioli and pasta with clams. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she said the manicotti was delicious. I took her recommendation only to have her come back 5-10 mins later to tell me they were out of manicotti. She didn't bring a menu and so I asked for a vegetarian recommendation - preferably something with lots of veggies. She offered the homemade spaghetti with marina. We also ordered a very delicious bottle of Shiraz that she recommended. My pasta was okay but didn't feel like a special night out dinner. I didn't try the clams, but did taste the pasta and there was zero flavor. I was shocked. I assumed the pasta would be in a butter clam sauce - no, tasted like unsalted tasteless pasta. There did seem to be an adequate amount of clams in the shell in the dish. The butternut squash ravioli was definitely the shining star of the night. Homemade ravioli, creamy squash filling with plenty on toasted cheese on top. Overall a nice dinner but not mind blowing. The waitress was nice but I had to ask for more water and the whole snafu with recommending something they were out of was a bit off putting."

Last night was so delicious, we are committed to coming more often. We started with the artichoke hearts, that came with a lemony-garlic aioli that was delicious and addictive. Then we had the beet salad - incredible delightful balance of sweet beets and pecans with the contrasting vinaigrette dressing - we LOVED it, ate every bit. Then I had the Osso Bucco, and my husband had the butternut squash lasagne. They were both divine -Osso Bucco so tender, and smothered in delicious root vegetables with an amazing sauce they were simmered in, all over a delightful potato cake. I was not prepared to like his butternut squash lasagne, and instead it knocked my socks off. The cheese combination with the squash and layers was unbelievable, so pleasing and inspired. The portions were generous however we couldn't stop, and ate it all. Which meant taking our delicious 1/2 order of focaccia home, and forfeiting the opportunity to sample their desserts. No matter -we'll be back! And sooner, next time. Go and enjoy, you won't be disappointed!"

"Burrata Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/burrata-bistro-poulsbo?osq=Italian+Food","Alison M.","We smelled the food coming from this place and saw some appetizers being served as my friend and I walked by one night and decided we'd come back for dinner if we had time.
Two days later we did have time - so we came back and were easily seated inside at around 5pm for dinner.
Our server was friendly and explained some items on the menu we had questions about.
We started with a half order of the Focaccia bread served with oil for dipping because we had seen it before and needed it - plus our server said it was amazeballs. It was. It's THICK and it's fresh and soft and so yummy. I don't know what it is - but it's just amazing. I ate way more than I thought I would. A half serving is still pretty damn big so unless you have more than 2-3 people in your party - you don't need a full-size because you can't eat it all and you'll want to.
I went with the Sun-Dried Tomato and Pesto Lasagna - described as having homemade pasta layered with sun-dried tomato and pesto served over marinara. That's pretty much what it was. It was good. $16.75.
I also chose to get the Burrata Summer Caprese because I am obsessed with Caprese salads and get them everywhere. Mozzarella with over-roasted tomato and basil pesto. It was OK. But not the best Caprese salad I've had by a long shot - $12.50.
My friend chose the Cannelloni which I had never heard of - I tasted it - it was good. Handmade pasta wrapped around pork and veal sauced with marinara and béchamel. It was served in a baked large side dish. $16.75
For dessert I heard they had tiramisu and I asked the waiter if it was really good and authentic because I'm picky.... he assured me it was. It was not my favorite. I'm REALLY picky about tiramisu and this was just a disappointment. I didn't even finish it. I can't remember the cost - but it was probably $8 or so.
All in all I think we spent close to $80 including the tip. The location is in the heart of historic downtown Poulsbo with a good menu and cute patio seating outside to people watch at dinner time."

Now the food... I had the grilled chicken with linguine. Very flavorful with garlic and herbs, olive oil, and some heat from chili flakes. Perfectly cooked linguine. Served a little more formal than I was expecting which was a nice plus. Food tastes home made versus mass produced like food chain food.
I highly recommend."
"Pasta Nova","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-nova-woodinville?osq=Italian+Food","Y P.","The food is good, the customer service has a long way to go.
If your credit card machine is down, you should let people know when they come in. Writing all the credit cards and CVV numbers in a notebook and asking customers to sign it, is not OK. Anybody who gets the book (such as another customer or any worker) will have dozens of credit card numbers with names and CVVs. Great opportunity for credit card theft.
Oh, if customers say they will order their mains after the appetizers, that is exactly what they mean. No need to ask them 3 times if they want to order even before the appetizers have arrived!
This restaurant has wonderful music and great lighting. If it was not for the chit-chat of the workers behind the bar, the night would have been even more pleasant."

"Pasta Nova","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-nova-woodinville?osq=Italian+Food","Alex J.","I've been here quite a few times before and the food was always decent, but the service was always slow and not particularly attentive. Nothing standout but good enough to come back. However, this time was a particularly poor experience. The restaurant was half empty but since I came in with a larger group of 7 people, we were prepared to wait a while.
That said, we were told that they could not accommodate us at all - and not because there were outstanding reservations, or the restaurant was full, but simply because the kitchen did not want the ""added burden"" of having to serve 7 additional diners (we arrived at 7pm). We told them we could split up the groups, that the dishes could be fired and served whenever ready, and that we were willing to wait as we had already driven there. The hostess went back to the chef and was told there was no way we were getting served that night.
Listen, I understand a larger group can be inconvenient, but we were willing to be as flexible as possible to be accommodated - we were polite, we were patient, and we were willing to wait. The restaurant isn't tiny - 7 people, half empty restaurant, at peak dinner times shouldn't gridlock any functioning kitchen. The arbitrary refusal of service was rude, the reasons kept shifting (oh, we actually have a lot of reservations later tonight), and then another group walked in without a reservation and was seated and accommodated immediately.
As a local, building a community and dynamic around great service and positive interactions is what specifically brings me back to certain establishments. I've dealt with a number of different dining situations in which far more unreasonable requests were met with great service and attitude from owners or staff. The food is fine, but given this experience and interaction with the staff, we will not be coming back and instead recommend choosing somewhere else to spend your money."

Also check out that water pitcher when they water you! Fancy schmancy stuff is going on here! Poor lighting conditions for food Paparazzi though--it's VERY dimly lit.
Excellent customer consideration regarding the outside temperatures since they have a curtain around the front door to shield you from drafts. You can dine in peace without feeling like Marylyn Monroe.
Menu is small and there seems to be more wine options than food items on the menu. But everything
Service: wait to be seated, order at the table: food, water, and check brought to you.
Complimentary warm bread and oil. Delicious! Too bad they don't give you more.
Chicken Tuscan: oh man that tang! Very good but might be too sour for some. The chicken is a whole breast fillet that you cut yourself. There is only one hunk of artichoke heart and one grape tomato on top of a few leaves of spinach. A slightly smaller proportion than what I'm used to but hey, that leaves you room for an appetizer or dessert.
Rigatoni Amatriciana: personally I'm a big fan of rigatoni so I like this dish. Comes with sliced Italian sausage and chicken. Italian sausage is slightly spicy but nothing I couldn't handle--I'm extremely sensitive to spice and I was fine."

"Pasta Nova","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-nova-woodinville?osq=Italian+Food","Laiha C.","A coworker recommended this quaint little Italian restaurant, so on our way to a Halloween party on Saturday we decided to give it a go.
It is very cute inside. Traditional Italian flare you tend to see, but more intimate, which I quite liked. It gave the vibe you were in a basement joint in Brooklyn. The lighting was dim and warm.
As were the staff... I'm pretty sure our server was the owner. He was adorable, demure and very kind. He made sure we were well taken care of.
Our food was delicious, in a word. My mushroom ravioli was exactly what I had hoped it would be. Creamy and rich but not heavy, filled with a variety of flavorful mushrooms. Yum.
Hubby got the spaghetti bolognese and was happy with his choice. That huge meatball he said was delicious, and I loved the sauce. It was so flavorful with a hint of spice.
This is not the old spaghetti factory, prices are much higher, so I see us coming back for a special occasion or to introduce friends to it."

I had the Caesar Salad and the Puttanesca gluten-free pasta - flavors were spot on, presentation was excellent, service was ok. So, in short, I would go back. BUT, I'm leaving a little hungry :( They have a $4 up charge for gluten-free pasta. I buy this stuff, so I know it's not that much to get good GF pasta for a reasonable price. So WHY am I leaving hungry? Small portions - maybe my wife would like the weight loss effect....... But, it's lunchtime, I'm hungry, and I just spend almost $50 on the ticket and....... I'm still hungry. I would be ecstatic about this place if I was full - really, the puttanesca was fabulous. Oh, and this is the one time I would have taken dessert, (I'm hungry!) But the server didn't offer it. Another good point - the wine was spot on! A very nice Italian Sangiovese - but, when I was done with the first glass and ready to have a second with the rest of my pasta, it took over 5 minutes and some waving to get my glass refilled - and he never refilled my water. I KNOW - First world problems....."

"Pasta Nova","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-nova-woodinville?osq=Italian+Food","Cyleste K.","My date and I have not had much luck with finding great new places to eat. We decided to try this place based on the high reviews. When we were there, the place wasn't crowded. The server asked if we had reservations. We said no. Server deliberated for a few minutes then said she would clear off a table. Could we wait 5-10 minutes? We said yes. She asked are you sure? We said yes. That was weird. I went to use the restroom and he was seated. I thought, ok, that wasn't much of a wait. I am sorry I cannot tell you the server's name nor the special... was never offered. Since we were on a date enjoying our time, I must have missed everything that the establishment did not provide to live up to such high reviews:
Ordered GAMBERON LINGUINE
Jumbo prawns and scallops tossed with linguine in a light and flavorful rosa sauce and finished with Dungeness Crab meat.
Sounds delicious right? Where is this rosa sauce? It was non existent. The linguine was dry. It was not fresh. I had to put in the olive oil that was from the bread to make it work. There was a lot of steam coming out of the dish. It was just heated up on high. The only thing that was prepared on the spot was the seafood lightly cooked. But one small bit of Dungeness crab meat on top of 1 scallop and 3 shrimps. Nothing to rave home about.
2nd dish LINGUINE BOLOGNESE
Traditional homemade Italian sauce with a giant meatball. pasta may be substitute for risotto.
Again, dry linguine and where is the sauce? Nothing to soak up. When I cut into this giant meatball it was dry too.
Cons:
-Service was flat, no personality
-linguine, dry.
-where is the sauce? Barely any sauce
-meatball huge, dry.
-coffee, asked for espresso shot, got regular drip coffee in a mug. No sugar or cream offered.
Pros:
-fast, food came out promptly
-tiramusu was good
Overall: over priced, under delivered"

"Pasta Nova","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-nova-woodinville?osq=Italian+Food","Nina B.","We decided to try this restaurant for the first time. It took nearly an hour to get our food. While we waited, we felt pretty ignored. Our waters weren't refilled at all except once and we weren't offered any additional bread while we waited or kept appraised as to why it was taking so long. But, once it did come out, it tasted good. The poor couple next to us got to the restaurant before us and got their food after us and their dishes came out staggered at least 10 minutes apart. I felt so bad for them. They refused their meals and at first the manager wasn't willing to take them off the check. After several back and forth exchanges, they finally got their meals removed from their bill. The manager should have not questioned them and removed the meals immediately and comped their drinks and appetizers.
This place Hs a very tiny kitchen. If it's busy when you come be prepared to wait a very long time."

It was very rich in flavor and was served with warm pita. The portions were reasonable and the ambiance was very homey. Be sure to save food for dessert because the baklava was extremely rich and decadent.

"The Olive and Grape","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-olive-and-grape-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","Catching up on belated Yelp posts and this was for a visit on 4/15/18. I was a bit hesitant due to the uneven Yelp reviews, but the Seattle Restaurant Week menu was intriguing ($33 for three courses).
We usually visit Kalia next door or Razzi's across the street. But I have driven past The Olive and Grape for several years in Seattle's Greenwood neighborhood...figured it's time to give it a try.
We had 5pm reservations and were seated a few minutes prior. Literally within the first half hour, the entire restaurant was full. I was impressed by the interior, the wait staff, and especially the two men working the kitchen line having to deal with the onslaught of diners showing up around the same time.
Beverages: Coke, local beer on tap, and me sticking with water
Starters: two orders of calamari and one order the Turkish platter with pita, dolma, borek, and a grilled lamb skewer.
Entrees: Chicken Parmigiana with pasta, Lamb Shank with potato puree, and Fruitti di Mare with pasta
Dessert: two orders of baklava (generous two triangles) and one order of tiramisu (used Turkish coffee vs. espresso)
Surprisingly a delicious and satisfying dinner...as I waddled back to our car with a major food baby, patting my stomach!"

The server/waitress was really friendly and accommodating when we asked to sit in a different location. The chef came up and checked-up on us whether the food was okay. I would say that it's a bit pricey, but it is probably what's expected around here. I'm glad that we we had the Passport card where the decor entree was free."

I enjoy this restaurant for its lovely ambiance, friendly staff and good food and wine. Not to mention the best gelato in town!
I love their appetizers; especially the scrumptious fried cauliflower, and the lamp pieces on a stick. They are so tender and delicious, I often make a meal of just appetizers. And then there is that scrumptious lamb steak smothered in a light mushroom sauce. Delectable!
Paola and husband Chris are lovely, friendly people, and lately their sweet son Tristan has joined them. He's doing a great job!
It's just wonderful in the summer when their big door is open to the street.

Their special menu had some wonderful choices. I opted for the lamb shank, a Mediterranean sampler for appetizer, and cannoli for dessert. All were delightful. The lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender, flavorful and nicely seasoned, accompanied by mashed potatoes. We share a bottle of wine with our friends from a wine list that's small, but offers a nice selections of whites and reds from lighter to full-bodied. The dining room was nicely decorated and lighted, not too noisy and very comfortable. The owner greeted us and took our order.

"The Olive and Grape","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-olive-and-grape-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathy A.","Super cute and quaint ambiance. Otherwise boy does this place have some problems!
To start, I had the aperol spirtz, they bring me my drink and there is a bug literally crawling in it. I thought I was crazy but I showed it to everyone at my table and they all agreed. Of course they kindly replaced it but yikes!
Service was also atrocious. They seemed rushed, frantic and angry with each other and frankly us. For example, when dishes were placed in front of the wrong diner (ie I ordered the seafood duo but they gave it to the person across from me and gave me someone else dish) they acted as if it was our fault. I didn't care and would gladly swap with my co-diners after all of the dishes were brought out but instead one of the other servers came and yelled at the other right in front of us and then he corrected it and said to the entire table in a very snarky voice ""is that correct, can I trust you guys?"" Also, service was incredible slow.
Food was also very subpar and they frankly ignored what we ordered. I ordered an arugula salad and asked for dressing on the side. I got the exact opposite. My salad was swimming in salad dressing to the point that it was draining into a large pool at the edges of the plate.
The seafood duo was also just doused in oil and salt. Flavorful but I'm sure my blood pressure went up a good 20 points.
Dessert was baklava and gelato and it was tasty but the baklava was very hard and we all struggled to cut into our pieces.
Needless to say I do not plan on returning."

The only place we have found so far that actually has Turkish taste in the Turkish dishes they have in the menu. We thought they had a Turkish chef, since the meat was done so perfectly. But it was the owners themselves, who are just doing an excellent job! One of the owners, Paola, is a wonderful host, she makes you feel super comfortable and welcome. The mezes are right on spot, very delicious. Their presentation of Raki is great. And the prices are pretty good especially considering the quality of the food & service.

Ended up sharing everything on the 3 course menu with my 2 friends so we got to try 9 things in all which was a great way to do it.
Grilled shrimp appetizer was good but nothing super different than other places. I'm not vegetarian but our eggplant dish and portobello dish were great. I didn't miss the meat since they were both so flavorful.
Bottom line - glad I tried it. Food was good, but I'm not sure I'm craving it enough to make it a regular in my list."
"The Olive and Grape","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-olive-and-grape-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Annie R.","The food was ok. I work for Microsoft and so do my friends and we came as a group since it's BOGO with our Microsoft passport discount. Long story short- the website and terms and conditions said max 2 BOGO per table but the owner only let us use one. No big deal, but he refused to honor his own terms and conditions with his agreement. If you're not gonna honor it, don't offer BOGO. Second, my food was gross but theirs was good. They got the gyro platter, it was delicious. I got the gnocchi, it tasted ok but I wouldn't order it again. It was also pretty pricy, $20 for gyros when there's tons of other options in Seattle and it's like $7. Without use of BOGO, I wouldn't come back."

"Veneto Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/veneto-italian-restaurant-silverdale?osq=Italian+Food","Kimber R.","What a cute little spot. Don't let the outside fool you! Even though it's located in a little strip of seemly worn down shops, this place is anything but worn down. With a little more than a dozen tables, this intimate little Italian restaurant is perfection. It's a little on the darker side inside, which gives it a romantic feel and on some nights, a lone guitarist plays gently by the door while you eat.
The food is wonderful. You get a plate of bread with dipping oil when you sit down and I could eat my weight in it. Then the big show. They are great if you want to substitute a pasta type into your dish(I get angel hair with my chicken Alfredo). I've never met someone who got a dish there that they didn't love. The portions are great as well. I always end up taking some of it home to enjoy later.
My only gripe that took a star is that all three times I have gone, the service is slow. It takes a while to get drinks refilled and the time between coming in, ordering and getting your food is just a tad too long. Refilling drinks is always a big thing to me. I hate to have to flag someone down to get more water. But other than that, this place is a real winner."

The first time I went the service was lack luster, but the coffee & tiramisu were both to die for. The second time was fantastic, both my husband and I adored our meals. Tonight I decided to try my luck and order to go, as it's raining like crazy outside. I got home, so excited to enjoy my calzone, just to find that it was both burnt and cold. My husbands chicken sandwich was also burnt and cold. I guess it's just a hit & miss kind of place. Definitely won't be ordering to go food from here ever again though."

I'm only giving it 4 stars for ambience, because it's a super chill, casual, vibe - but honestly, if that's what you want (and we did that day) it's 5 stars for everything that matters. The food was above and beyond. Also - I had a small issue with my pasta dish, and I'm super uncomfortable sending things back.

"Veneto Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/veneto-italian-restaurant-silverdale?osq=Italian+Food","Kristiana K.","Italian food is typically pretty standard in this country, but this place always blows my mind. I don't come in very often, but I order from Uber eats all the time. The mushroom risotto, fried ravioli, and gnocchi are my faves."
"Veneto Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/veneto-italian-restaurant-silverdale?osq=Italian+Food","Katarina W.","Went here for the first time and we tried the Risotto con Fungi, The Ravioli Fritta and the Gnocchi with Gorganzola sauce , we also tried the Chocolate flourless cake, the creme brulee and the cannolis.
The waitress that we had was.... okay. Not overtly friendly, no small talk, and took a long time for general service. She rarely smiled and almost seemed like she didn't care to be there, it's always pretty unsavory to me when you have someone working customer service that acts in such a way. I've managed multiple food establishments before and having employees that exude good customer service should be of the utmost importance.
Now, the food, the Gnocchi was good, not the best gnocchi we have had as it was a bit gummy, but it was good enough. The ravioli was good but how can you screw up fried ravioli. The Risotto was delicious, and I mean very very delicious. Great flavor! No regrets about ordering it.
The creme brulee was enjoyed greatly by my mother in law however I believed the flavor was a bit odd, mostly the consistency was kinda funky and it definitely was not the best creme brulee I've had before. The cannolis were pretty good, in fact it was nice to see that they truly were a sweetened ricotta filling whereas a lot of places around here almost taste more like a cream cheese frosting filling so this was pleasant to see they were more traditional. The chocolate flourless cake was a different texture than the average flourless cake but it was still good flavor, only wish that the piece was cut a little larger for the price.
Overall, the food was good, we would definitely be back for it again, service could use a remodel though ;)"

That being said the reason why I gave them 3 stars is the last few times I have ordered their calamari it was quite rubbery and doughy. I still love it here but I love it a hella of a lot better if the consistency with the appetizers stays on point"

Housemade sangria was very yummy, the happy hour large was an okay size. A lot of ice and a thick glass made it seem larger than it was, I think.
We tried the fried ravioli and ordered the bruschetta. I'd never tried fried ravioli before?? It was bomb, obviously, it's probably pretty hard to screw that up. Instead of bruschetta we were served caprese salad on bread which, if I'm being honest, we didn't realize until after we left. It was pretty decent, the bread they served it on was the same as the dipping bread you get which is fine, tasty, maybe a little old. I would have liked it crunchier. We got in the car and I was like, wait.. that was not bruschetta ‍
He really liked the lemony chicken and capers thing I forget what it's called. i think chicken picatta. I thought it was too damn lemony but I also don't know what it's supposed to taste like. He ate almost all of it except the veggies that were just like steamed with some sort of garlicness.
I got the housemade gnocchi with meat sauce and meatballs and, well, I was very disappointed. The texture of the gnocchi was good, but the sauce and meat was SO salty it was almost inedible. I wish there was more of the fresh white cheese dolloped on top because that really helped mellow it out. The meatballs were kind of tasty, but over cooked.
Overall, just disappointing . The woman working there was very nice and patient with our deciding but it was soooo salty!
I settled on two stars because the ravioli and his food was good, the caprese was okay but not what we'd ordered, and I choked down the gnocchi. Perhaps I'll try it again some time because a lot of people love it, but I just was not pleased."

This time around we started with caprese and a Caesar salad. For our main entree I had the chicken parmigiana while my wife had the crab cannelloni. We both loved our meal. For dessert we shared an amazing piece of tiramisu. The tiramisu was creamy, moist, and just the right amount of coffee flavor."

"Veneto Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/veneto-italian-restaurant-silverdale?osq=Italian+Food","L C.","The two stars is purely for service. I ordered takeout here 2 days ago. The hostess was courteous, prompt and accommodating. No issues with service. I ordered a house salad...salad would have been fine if it was not dressed at the restaurant. Generally in to-go orders the restaurants package the dressing separately so that the salad doesn't wilt into mush. The next dish was fried calamari. The calamari was over cooked, tasted like the product was purchased pre-made and fried in house. The sauce that was given with it reminded me of a tablespoon of marinara in a cup of hot water. The spaghetti Bolognese was greasy, as if the noodles were coated in butter or oil, and a few measly bits of meat clung to the noodles, no ragu to really speak of. A copious amount of unidentifiable cheese was melted on top. The tortellini in a Parmesan cream sauce (because let's be real, that was not Alfredo) was somehow both chewy and mushy, as well as bland. There were a couple of items that came with the meal. The bad: Stale bread with a dipping sauce. The good (and overwhelmingly best part of the meal): Andes Mints. There was a sign in the window that said they were hiring waitstaff, but I would strongly recommend hiring a new executive chef."
"Veneto Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/veneto-italian-restaurant-silverdale?osq=Italian+Food","Ss S.","Spaghetti pomodoro- they make their red sauce homemade and it is delicious.
Fried calamari- It was just right, chewable and easily digestible as some other restaurants overcook their calamari and chews like rubber. This one is pretty good and i like the marinara sauce spice.
Veal Marasala- The seasoning with the white wine is very tasty. I would order all these again.
Customer service- Mattie is very helpful and cheery. :)
Their bread is homemade and I would recommend this cute restaurant."

A small menu full of delicious staples done exactly right by a very small team. A lot of food trucks are not very good, but this is the kind of food truck that made them a fad in the first place. I've paid twice as much to eat pasta that wasn't half as good, so this is the real deal to me.
I'm looking forward to more from them. I'm especially looking forward to seeing what this truck does when they have fresh chanterelles. I saw a chanterelle sticker on the window and asked about it and they said they serve them when the chef can find fresh ones. When everything is so well done, that gets really exciting for me.
The only issue I have with this place is that their food is so good it would pair well with good wine and they don't sell wine. Usually when the food is so good I'm nearly deliriously happy from eating it I have wine with it.
I hope to see this truck around a lot. Keep up the good work."

I ordered a chicken parmigiana with spaghetti noodles and it was pretty much the perfect dinner. The thin chicken cutlet was coated in a delicious cheesy crust, and served atop freshly-cooked spaghetti with a big heap of their house-made marinara on top. My only complaint is I couldn't finish the whole thing - the portion was HUGE! It was the perfect accompaniment to my Reuben's beer. I will definitely be seeking this truck out in the future!"

Another experimentation with pork belly has always lead to successful cuisine combinations and carbonara is once again justified for all the pasta lovers. Each noodle size smaller than adult teeth to insure a seamless and fluid bite down. With it's cheesy mixtures to tone down the viscosity and your bite powers, your observation of a warm cooked meal is a slow motion endeavor that gives the illusion of a slurpy session, but in reality a speedy booking to the hunger rooms to insure full capacity is attained in less than the total time taken to prepare and cook the meal. Food trucks have provided new exploration tasks and such side quest like Bella was an accidental encounter worth investing. It will surely be re-visited for additional experience."

I recommend the pasta as well, both gnocchi and bucatini. The sauces they use for each of them (so far I've had red + pesto) are AMAZING. I feel like I get restaurant quality food and presentation here every time, without the fuss and hassle of going to a ""real"" restaurant.
I've visited at both brewery night and at the mini Pod. I really like the mini pod set up during the week because it's so cute and parking is actually somewhat easy to find. Don't forget to try the cannoli!!"

It's everything you want: Garlic, melted mozzarella, juicy perfectly seasoned meatball, toasted buttery bun, and pesto to cut through the richness. Didn't know I needed pesto on the sandwich but I'm sure as hell am not going without it from now.
I had a whole sandwich for lunch and ate half of my wife's for dinner.
The meatball with spaghetti was also a good life choice. I'm sorry that I took a picture with the carrot garnish still on it. We ate all of it so I can't take a new picture right now."

We had the meatball sandwich and the pasta with sausage on it but by that point we were so peeved from waiting for 2 hours that it was hard to really enjoy the food itself.
They capped off the night by trying to call""Last Call"" at 7:45p (again scheduled to be there on a Saturday night until 9p). The Sounders, Huskies, M's, and Cougs were all still playing at this point and the brewery was busy. Will not be providing them any business in the future."

I had the creamy salmon pasta and it tasted like it came from a freezer. I could have made the same thing at home easily for half the price.
Then I tried the cannoli. It was cold and tasteless. The filling had a weird texture and the outside crust was too hard.
I figured I would give it one more shot, and I tried the meatball sandwich. The taste was mediocre (minimal seasoning) and the meatballs themselves were absolutely massive and had the most disgusting texture. I could not believe how expensive it was for two giant hunks of meat.
I felt like an idiot trying three separate times. But I don't be buying anything from them again."

We live within a 4 minute (if not less) walking distance but never felt compelled to come here. I grew up in Shoreline so I knew about the chain but even then had probably just gone in once.
My girlfriend had suggested we try it and I obliged since I had already eaten at Talaricos and figured I could just get a salad. Our first experience here was great, the server was very accommodating, super nice and our food came out quickly. I got the house salad and a side of chicken breast, chicken was a little burnt but fine. House salad was fresh. No complaints. Gf got the pasta with blush sauce and loved it, she said it was creamy and rich. She echoed my sentiments about the house salad but said her olives (I didn't get any) tasted bad. She had nothing to say about the garlic bread.
On our second visit here with some friends, my gf got the same thing. She said it was fine. I ordered a pizza with our friends and we had asked about adding chicken to it, our server immediately said, ""we don't add chicken to our pizzas"" and yet you can order a piece of chicken as a side. She didn't mention it to us, just said no. Then she asked us about splitting the bill and told us they don't split pizzas in half (price). We had just inquired because we wanted to know but we were met with some rudeness. It was a very interesting experience overall. The pizza was okay, felt burnt on top. I was super hungry so I ate it but I also knew my stomach was going to hurt. The menu hadn't adequately advertised how much cheese was on it, just mentioned the types.
Overall, we won't be coming back any time soon...which is sad because we live so close. My friend who lives in Shoreline and frequents Spiros up there was shocked at the service we received."

The food left a lot to be desired. I ordered pasta and my girlfriend ordered pizza which we then shared. The pasta was ok at first, but had so much oil that it was nearly inedible halfway through. The pizza was also just ok, but for the price paid we both expected more. We also ordered a bottle of wine, and were brought the wrong bottle but didn't notice until after it had been opened and poured for us. Pricewise the wine was not worth it. I know there are restaurant markups, but we paid nearly $30 for an $8 dollar bottle of wine.

It's really different than most of the pizza you find in the area, which I'm not a big fan of. The last time we were there, there was a big party in the side room so it was pretty noisy.

I will say my initial experience is what really surprised me - fast service and delicious, affordable food! Second experience very meh but still good. It appears to be locally owned, with a lax staff. Which is nice. My parties had a few awkward moments with the staff - perhaps because we are still new to the area / are especially new to this restaurant. I personally have ordered the same pasta both experiences, blush sauce pasta with a salad and bread. Totally worth the price. That being said second time around I thought, maybe it's just good cause I don't eat pasta at all - and while I am definitely going to be back (bc yum!) I've made easily comparable meals with minimal effort. Don't mean it isn't good, just means I'll pick this place over my own work if 1) I don't wanna cook 2) I wanna go out. That being said it 100% is the best pasta I've had so far around (I haven't been to the fancier joints around - just the usual family style Italian places, aka all the pasta prices are about the same - 10-15$)."

Last night was the last straw; once again, they didn't care that the order had been screwed up and I didn't have enough time to have the pizza remade. Just shrugged and took my card.
My favorite moment remains the time a couple of months ago when I called on the phone to order, got put on hold for 15 minutes, got tired of being on hold and walked down to order with my phone still with me, ordered at the counter, and waited and got my pizza, still able to see the light blinking on the phone to show I was on hold. In all fairness, it was a Friday evening and they were fairly busy.
FWIW, they are always friendly and customers in the restaurant always seem to be having a good time. I would avoid takeout, however. The food is not tasty enough to outweigh the unreliability."

Also, *do not* get parmesan on your pizza when they offer! I thought they meant a sprinkling of some parmesan cheese like your mom used to do... no, it's a complete thick layer that you cannot remove as you eat (see picture)."

The restaurant was full for a mid day, but some I am sure some people like me had Monday off. I will say the restaurant was run by mostly young (high school/early college) employees. Service was good, they were attentive to customers.
My big complaint was that the wine glasses that were on the clean table were clearly dirty and even so with the empty clean table next to us had the same thing.
As for food I ordered the seafood fettuccini which was okay, I didnt think the sauce was as thick and flavorful as I was hoping for but the mojito I ordered was great. I also liked the $5 lunch to take home. Overall I think it's a little pricy for the quality of entree but I love the bread and zuppa Toscana soup."

*any of the soups 1/5
*salad 4/5
*bread sticks 4/5
*chicken parm 2/5
*deep fried ravioli 1/5
*spaghetti 2.5/5
*4 cheese penny Pasta 3.5/5
-my meal came with unlimited soup. They all tasted like they have been sitting out for a while and the meat in the noodle soup that looks like tomato soup tasted like really poor quality.
-definitely have the salad. Was extremely surprised to have a good salad here. A little heavy on the dressing but still good.
-breadsticks as everybody knows are great here and are always the same. They can't mess this one up.
-The chicken Parmesan was over cooked garbage. inedible and horrible.
-The deep fried ravioli tasted like it had been fried three times over. More fried than anything else. Also inedible.
-The spaghetti was OK but it would be better fresh. I could make better spaghetti at home.
-The four cheese Penny pasta it was the meal I got to take home for five dollars. it was worth getting.
dont go here, food is not good. also expensive $15-$19 per person."

"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-kirkland-2?osq=Italian+Food","Anne M.","Have come here at various times in the last few years, experiences have always differed.
Pros: never had to wait too long, staff have always been nice to me (unlike others reviews, I seem to be lucky!), if there have been issues, staff have resolved them for me, and politely!
Cons: Food is lukewarm for some bizarre reason. Menu is expensive for a chain - that's not this locations fault though, as that is set at corporate level! I think because salad/breadsticks are part of the meal, they up the prices to cover this ""complimentary"" service.
Overall, this location has good amount of parking, sometimes the outside can be dirty, which isn't ideal when entering a restaurant. Food doesn't look appetizing, but taste isn't the worst. They try really hard, and can see that in the manager feedback too. Consistency depends on when you go, it needs to be consistent more regularly though!"

We would ask for more bread and salad and it didn't come until we were done with all our food. We didn't even enjoy the food because of how bad the service was, very disappointed.

We both ordered an oven baked pasta dinner, even though we didn't see the special listed on the menu - but, I trusted the TV ad. The bill came with the full price of $21.99 each. Neither the waitress nor the manager heard of the ""special"" or knew anything about it.

First let me say the Host stand is staffed by mean girls. Little eye contact and kinda rude. And the ladies room was really neglected. When I mentioned it I got a canned response that made me think they hear this way too often. I should have left.
My waitress was fine if hurried, but my requests misfired. My martini with no vermouth was pretty watery and did have vermouth. I drank it as she seemed stressed. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana with angel hair rather than spaghetti and asked for very little salad. I think she tried to make a small salad but it was still too much. As for my entree: spaghetti all the way.
Beyond that, I should also remember that good Italian food is not likely there. Greasy and bland at the same time. I need some sort of a taser that stops me when about once a year I think to try try again."

There was no wait so we got seated immediately and Yaritza was our waitress . I'll say she did a great job , very attentive and always checking on us , and great with my kids as well. I can't stand when a server allows guests to sit with an empty cup while they are eating because duh we get thirsty while we eat haha. I needed a refill and it sat for maybe one minute and she brought another drink for me, I didn't even have to say anything !!
As far as the food goes , all 4 of us were happy with our meals, everything tasted great and we were pleasantly surprised the breadsticks were unlimited. The best place to go if you feel like carb loading !!! We probably won't be back for a while , and not because of anything bad , we just like to explore new places !"
"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-kirkland-2?osq=Italian+Food","Elisabeth P.","We were prompted to try this Olive Garden for their Veterans Day menu. Many businesses do a nice Veterans Day special or discount for active military and retired. Olive Garden offers a free meal off a special menu with a pretty nice selection. The husband apparently has better foresight than Professor Trelawney from HP and anticipated there might be a wait. He easily made reservations online and despite the hangry mob in the waiting room, we were seated upon arrival.
Our server was pleasant and attentive. They brought out the usual salad and kept off the croutons for me since I'm a no choice allergy member of the glutenisgross club. If an Olive Garden salad is something new to you, well then, the dressing is about its only redeeming quality and helps make the iceberg lettuce palatable. Their gf menu includes a gf pasta prepared in separate water and choice of marinara or meat sauce. There's not a lot of selection so I always go with the same meat sauce every time I find myself in an Olive Garden. It's mediocre but I definitely appreciate having a pasta option. The husband decided his free meal would be the chicken parm and overall found it to be nice and crispy and well prepared, but again there's just a mediocrity to this chain's sauces.
Our noms came out quickly despite it being a Sunday night and we were in and out in under an hour. I appreciated the kitchen's effort to keep me away from the glutens and we had a great server. We also always appreciate acknowledgment of our veterans and active duty military. Overall a solid Olive Garden location."

My server Jonathan S took our order and not even coming once after. Wow... my wife needed to order some drink but could not get his attention at all. Since Serious Pie automatically charge 20% service fee, it is all about getting more people in and not caring about the service? I raised my hand several times to get his attention but failed. Provide some service if you are going to charge 20% fee! What a bad service.

Neapolitan pizza & crispy on the outside with soft pillowy fluffy inside biscuits. Even though this is a larger spot, it does get really busy so be prepared if you come during peak hours. If you can sit upstairs, you might get lucky to get one of the few tables that overlook the kitchen and you can see a lot of their baking operations.
There are decent happy hour & lunch deals here, but there is no wrong time of the day for pizza! Their brunch is not to be meddled with either, as they have great shakshuka like bakes with their biscuits.
Overall, I'd highly recommend checking this spot out, and they have multiple locations in Seattle, except not all of them offer the same amazing biscuits."

We are regular visitors to the Virginia St. location but were hoping for shorter wait times. We were seated without a delay and the staff was very friendly. We ordered the fried chicken biscuit, the biscuit with butternut squash (special), the hushpuppies and the bacon fries. None of it was particularly interesting and didn't really have much flavor. The hushpuppies have some spice and tend to overwhelm the more delicate profiles that might be there. I found the same with the chicken and the fries (potato cubes) were good but also lacked a significant savory flavor.
We will always come back for pizza but probably won't do the biscuits again. If you have a choice and this is your first visit, always go for pizza."

Decor is industrial. Layout is designed for a practical and spacious seating area.

"Serious Pie & Biscuit","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-and-biscuit-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Vinh N.","Biscuits for breakfast and brunch is a great option, however, the quality and service is just not the same level as the original location on Virginia.
This location has much more seating and a full bar with many more beer options. But ultimately the food falls short and I am all about the food. The pizza crust is not as crispy all around, the flavors aren't as deep, the cheese isn't shaved as even and as generously as the original location.
Unfortunately, service also fell short. They were understaffed and things kept on getting forgotten. Whether it's utensils, drinks, menus there was something that was always a little off. After reading other reviews of this location it seems like this is a trend.
I really, really like Serious Pie and the original location has been around for ~20 years. After hearing there was a newer larger location with more food options I was excited to visit, however I was pretty disappointed.
If you want a great, great experience I would recommended making the trek to the original location for that clam, pork, lemon thyme pie."
"Serious Pie & Biscuit","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-and-biscuit-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","John T.","My wife heard about this place from several friends so it was another stop on her list of must eats.... thankfully the last one :)
We initially ordered the Zach and the sweet fennel sausage pizza--- so we could try both a biscuit and a pie. My wife had a Coke and I had the House Gin & Tonic. However, while waiting for our order, my wife saw a pic of the ham hock/collared green biscuit and decided to order that as well.
The Zach was good. Nothing special but good. I liked the chicken the most in this dish. However, I think Biscuit Bitch had better biscuits, gravy, bacon, etc. The fennel sausage pizza was delicious. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the crust was amazing--- thin and crispy. The ham hock was amazing. I thought the whole dish was okay but my wife didn't care for the greens, and ended up eating the ham by itself. Further, the gin/tonic was decent. Lastly, portion size was pretty good. We ended up only eating the Zach and a third of the pizza and taking the rest of the pizza and the entire ham hock dish home for dinner.
While the food might get 4 stars, there's a couple things that irritate me. $15 for the Zach, $12 for the ham hock, and $10 for the gin were all overpriced. Secondly, as others noted, this restaurant automatically includes a 20% ""service fee"" in your bill, in lieu of a tip. While I'm not saying that our waiter didn't deserve 20%, I HATE that they don't tell you up front or in advance that that is included. I also feel that by doing that, you take the incentive away from the waiter/waitress to provide top notch service to each and every customer. If they know that the tip is already included, and the customer can't take that away, then why try at all?"
"Serious Pie & Biscuit","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-and-biscuit-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Tony J.","Pizza and Biscuits restaurant on the corner of Westlake and Harrison. They have a ground floor with a bar, some seating and a counter serve area, and a loft for more seating. Went there during weekday lunch, and the place was busy. There was a wait for the normal tables, but there is a small self-serve area with high top tables that was open, so we took that. There is no table service in that area, so you have to order and grabthe food from the counter and get your own water and cutlery.
As the name indicates, the food is primarily biscuits and pizzas. I got the Zach, which is their signature biscuit sandwich that has fried chicken, fried egg, and bacon and smothered in gravy. The biscuit was prepared pretty quickly. It's a hearty biscuit sandwich with a good piece of fried chicken. The cost was $15, which is a bit pricey for just one biscuit with no sides. For $15 and counter serve, I was expecting the portion to be at least 50% larger. The same goes for the pizzas which are $20 for a personal sized pizza. While the biscuits were prepared quickly, the pizzas take more time to bake, and we waited 20+ minutes for a pizza that someone in my party ordered."

Let me start with the pizza my daughter ordered. Sweet fennel sausage, roasted peppers, provolone. This was a red sauce pizza with an excellent sausage, peppers and cheese. The crust is thin and crispy, all the ingredients are made in house and the flavors blended well.
For mine I ordered a less traditional pizza. Soft eggs*, smoked prosciutto, pecorino sardo, arugula. The soft Eggs were a little runny as expected and the local grown arugula was fresh and in abundance. If I have any complaint at all it would be that i would have liked more smoked prosciutto, however this was not a deal breaker. An outstanding choice.
Now my curiosity had me, I have sampled the pie, but what of the biscuit? These dishes are served in the day before 3pm. I must return......
So the following day I am sitting at the bar ordering ""the Zach"" with fried egg and bacon fried chicken, tabasco black pepper gravy.
OMG to die for... Let's start with the gravy, obviously scratch in house nice amount of pepper and just a touch of heat, not enough to destroy the palate but enough to enjoy the flavors. The fried chicken was boneless of course and was breaded perfectly with a breading that was flavorful and complemented the gravy. The biscuits were absolutely perfect.
Do yourself a favor arrive hungry. The service is a little slow but not unreasonable. This gives you the opportunity to sample the many top shelf beers they offer...."
"Serious Pie & Biscuit","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serious-pie-and-biscuit-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Roger K.","Stick to the pizza's here. Although, a bit on the pricier side, I did come back to try some of the other menu items. Last time i had the truffle mushroom pie, that was great! Equally tasty, the sweet fennel sausage pizza i had this time. The jalapenos added a nice kick.
The only knock i had for my second time here is that i got something other than pizza. Fried chicken and biscuit, drenched in gravy was bland. Chicken wasn't really seasoned, and the gravy just didn't have much going for it. Home fries... same.
Stick to the pizza and you're golden! Just don't go overboard. They're a bit pricey."

I really had high hopes for Serious Pie, but the texture and flavor are off. The crust isn't quite chewy enough, and is often gritty throughout, instead of from a light cornmeal or semolina dusting on the bottom only. I don't like the salt sprinkled on the bread and toppings: it should be integrated into the components evenly. SP is among the better options in Seattle if you want pizza, but doesn't compare to an NYC pie."

The biscuits are topped with the chicken, an egg, and bacon with gravy on top. It was a delicious sandwich and I couldn't finish the whole thing. I would also recommend adding aardvark sauce which they have on the tables for an extra kick.
The left side of the restaurant is open seating and you order at the counter, while the right side is a traditional sit down restaurant.

The food is delicious and is prepared quickly, but just as importantly, the owners (Katarina and her husband) are two of the nicest, sweetest, and most friendly people I have ever met. There's limited space to eat inside, so plan to get your food to go! My favorite sandwich is hands-down the Turkey Pastrami Panini, although I have also fallen victim to the Spinach Delish Crepe or the Breakfast bagel. If you're eyeing up something sweet, I highly recommend the Nutella Crepe or Carrot Cake, as well as a quintessential go-to Chai Latte.
Do yourself a favor and check out Capital D cafe the next time you're around 15th - you will NOT regret it."

I've stopped by a couple times before appointments for coffee, and ended up getting food. So tasty! They prepare your salad from scratch right there. The lox bagel I had today was marvelous...toasted on the panini maker, which also flattened it enough to make it easy to eat! NOM."
"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kalpana R.","Ordered takeout from here which was a Medium size half Italian Sausage and Veggie and half Chicken & Goat Cheese Pizza.
I placed the order over Slice app and the pizza was ready for pickup 40 min later. It was pretty hot by the time I arrived home and tasted fresh. I liked both the flavors but the sausage+veggie was better of the two. The pizza had a decent quantity of cheese and the crust wasnt dry. It wasnt super oily either and the quantity was decent; we had couple of slices leftover after 2 folks eating.
I'll be back to try out other pizza flavors as well as test their pastas."
"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Corey H.","Ordered here from Slice. Ordered half sausage anchovy and half pepperoni, as I always do when trying a new place if they allow half orders as a baseline to see how I like the pizza. First time I was given artichokes instead of anchovy, pretty disappointing but oh well, the restaurant apologized, offered 25%off a future order and Slice offered $7 credit. So far just fine, nobody's perfect. Next day I figure I'll give them a shot at redemption while using up the discount and credit since it's a cheat weekend on keto for me so I didnt want to wait forever to use those up and wanted to give Modena a chance to make good on their error. This time the pizza was NOT EVEN CLOSE to what I ordered. As you can see in the photo, this time ""half sausage anchovy half pepperoni"" (input using the guide on the app that clearly shows which half to put toppings on and everything) translated to a full pizza of ""sausage, pepperoni, mushy Canadian bacon and white sauce"". This time they offered me a 10% discount on a future order...??? Like why the hell would I come back again after twice failing in a row and offering less of a fix than the first time? Good joke, bad pizza, bad customer service. Slice, on the other hand, gave me another $10 off for anywhere I want to use it, certainly won't be at Modena!!"
"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tabatha J.","Ditched leftovers & caved into pizza on my day off. Was very pleased to find I didn't have to leave the house today... they have free delivery (grub hub). Got the Modena special... medium (just in case) to get free delivery. Left over pizza makes a hardy breakfast or lunch carb heavy earlier in the day. Added spinach which I was expecting a call for them to tell me how much extra it would be- they just added it which was a pleasant surprise.
‍ Didn't time how long it took, it estimated 35-45. Based on where I ended up in my Letterman Episode I'd say it came in 25 min.
Crust was yummy... not too thick and a little chewy just like I it. Very flavorful, great amount of toppings. Only thing I'd change is it being a little less greasy but it had lots of pork product so some grease to be expected."

"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Angelo S.","Don't be fooled by the location of the restaurant and it's size. Walking in, we could already tell from the smell alone that this was going to be a fantastic dining experience. The owner of the restaurant was at the front desk and was very welcoming and helpful to us first timers. He walked us through the menu, and even had a laugh with us about how much food we ordered lol. They don't have servers at the restaurant but their kitchen staff doesn't make it seek that way - They cook, serve, and entertain. This family style restaurant will woo you over with their fresh ingredients and their tasty dishes. The first thing that arrived at our table was the salad. Very bright green veggies, paired with their light blue cheese dressing (they have other dressings of course). The taste set my appetite just right. We were so glad to find that our pizza would come shortly after as well as our pastas. They even gave us complimentary tiramisu which was just to die for. Thank you for such an amazing experience Modena!"
"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashleigh S.","This is my go-to location for deliveries. They do not have a delivery fee and have a $15 minimum, which is easily met with a medium pizza.
The only pizza I have tried from this location remains to be my favorite pizza in Seattle-- the Red Goat Pizza with red onions, red peppers, and goat cheese on regular crust and marinara. The flavors complement each other very well. This is an easy vegetarian option I order whenever I'm not feeling in the mood for meat. If I want to add a little more ""substance"" to the pizza, I add mushrooms (easy to do through the app).
I have branched out and tried a couple appetizer/side dishes to accompany my Red Goat pizza. The spicy garlic prawns are soooooooooo good. They have a nice kick and I usually put these on top of some freshly made linguine to divide into two meals. There's plenty of sauce to make this happen, and for that I am very appreciative. The cauliflower is ok. It was a bit bland for my taste but I still ate it, so yay veggies. Modena used to have a lobster ravioli as well and that was delicious. I didn't see it on the menu this last time I ordered, but hopeful it will come back.
Need to make my way into the physical location and check it out. As a delivery restaurant, Modena gets 5-stars and a monthly order from me!"

One bite (everybody knows the rules)

For the best salami and Canadian bacon I've ever had on a pizza
This is by far some of the best pizza I've ever had on the west coast
I would recommend this for an impressive dinner that is surprisingly quickly made and delivered for how much of a punch the pie packs.

"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy F.","TLDR: generous proportions.
Tip: Pasta comes with garlic bread and soup or salad. Half order of the garlic bread appetizer is 2 pieces vs 4 from a full order.
Small authentic Italian restaurant with mellow Italian music playing. Limited dining area--7 tables. Clean place. Most orders are to go.
Menu is all text. Sorry you visual folk--no pictures but the descriptions are ok.
Don't order too much especially if you get the pasta--it comes with garlic bread and soup or salad. The pasta proportions are pretty generous. Order it first and if you're still hungry, order more. Don't over order!
Service: wait to be seated, order at the table, leftovers will be boxed for you, check brought to table.
Italian Sausage Soup: a Soup of the day item. Sausage is homemade and has a delightful taste and spice. Tiny pastas in the clear broth are so satisfying to the palate. Perfect for warming up on a cold day!
Fettuccini Salmon: I love the capers! Salmon was a bit on the salty side but the fettuccine and sauce help counter it. The sauce is not too thick and is lightly flavored with garlic. I just wish there were more veggies.
Garlic bread: soft, light and fluffy with a slight outer crisp. Not too salty and has satisfying spices sprinkled on top.
Italian Sausage Pomodorini: Sausage is delicious and has a slight kick. The sauce is a bit on the tangy side--lots of tomato chunks. You might find yourself reaching for water or more bread with this one.
Tiramisu: homemade. Very light and fluffy! Not too sweet but enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. I kinda wished there was slightly more coffee flavor though. You know how when you eat tiramisu you can taste the individual layers as they hit your palate? This one, though it was tasty, had a more uniform taste--like the flavor soaked into the cake."

First time to order this particular entree and this was spot on. Penne pasta with Italian sausage, red onion, red chili flakes, tomato cream, and garnished with shaved parmesan. Not heavy and has a spicy kick.
Tiramisu here is decent. It's not dry, not soggy, not overly boozy, not cloying, and a steal at nearly $5.

I eat a lot of pizza. I went to this place based off the pepperoni pizza reviews alone. Walked up, highly question my decisions based off of the exterior. I WAS WRONG. IT IS AMAZING.

"Modena Pizza & Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/modena-pizza-and-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mark M.","Fairly decent product. The cheese crust was very good. The pizza that came with the cheese inside the crust was a Brooklyn style. Which was nice. Not very thick and just the right thinness.
Toppings were a little sparse and not very evenly distributed. Rather kind of just tossed on to the pizza. Quality of the ingredients was average. Salad was fresh and good size.
Overall the experience was pretty good and will probably order again sometime."

Two weeks later I try and make good on the offer and now they claim they were only giving me the topping for free.

The staff seemed overburdened. They were very slow to get to us but once they did, it wasn't a long wait for drinks or food.
And then we come to the food. We had two small plates: pesto cream gnocchi and cauliflower with romesco. The gnocchi was heavy, almost pasty, and clunky. The cauliflower was badly over-seasoned with salt, though the texture was pretty good. For dessert, coconut coriander rice pudding with pistachios. The portion was huge (like two cups) but the dish was also a miss. The rice was undercooked so the texture was less like pudding and more like pinhead oats.
Overall, I don't think we'll return."

The smoked tuna toasts were so delicious (I wish every time I made a tuna sandwich it tasted as good as that smoked tuna) with a sweet pepper as a perfect touch on top. The roasted cauliflower was good and flavorful, though admittedly my least favorite item we tried. The pan seared tuna (daily market fish) was expensive at $32 but wow it was flavorful. The sauce on top was tangy, refreshing, and I just couldn't get enough, and the fish had a beautiful crisp to it. The dungeoness crab spaghetti with a lemon butter wine sauce -- wow. Decadent, rich, and delicious with a piece of roasted bread dipped into it. I'm excited to go back and try more. The service could've been a bit faster, but the waiter was friendly and had a lot on his plate (hah)
Update: They now do brunch too! Homemade sweet potato English muffins with their eggs Benedict. The lemongrass braised short rib with kimchi Benedict was stellar and the apple streusel oven baked French toast... wow. The portions are huge so bring a friend to split!"

She was very knowledgeable and very patient in answering all our questions. She paced the meal well.
Unfortunately, only some of the food was great. The coq au vin and short ribs were delicious and well prepared. The fried chicken was wonderfully crispy and well-seasoned.
Some of the food was so-so. The red sauce for the meatballs was better than the meatballs themselves, which were too heavily seasoned with smoked paprika. None of us liked the meatballs, and yet scraped the last bit of sauce from the dish. The brussel sprouts (on the menu since day 1!) were tasty but extremely sweet. The would have been a better dessert than starter. The fries were crispy and hot, but we couldn't taste the black truffle at all. The Caesar salad had nice flavor, but the salt wasn't balanced between the fried capers, croutons, cheese and dressing (overly salty).
We will try it again, hoping the kitchen was having a bit of an off night."

Being a vegetarian,we had the artichoke artisan dip and roasted cauliflower for appetizers. The artichoke was the tastiest dip ever ! The cauliflower was a bit soggy but it had a cuminy taste which was good.
My friends also had the shrimp tacos and the seafood spaghetti which they raved on about !
They also have desserts per seasonal changes, we had the lava cake and the lemon strawberry tart. I am a dark chocolate fan, so i loved it. The tart had a subtle sugar taste which suited me.

I ordered the lamb shank and the meat was falling off the bone and juicy but flavorless. There was a bit of ground mint on top, but not a balancing of flavor, just a smack in the tongue of mint and lame lamb. The sweet potato, brussel sprout, etc... vegetable 'hash' was no hash but a medley of sorts and the flavor on the plate. I ended up eating each bite of lamb with brussel sprout halves to add flavor to meat."

They also have a nice menu that is simple yet good offerings. Clams were delicious! Not much seating and def gets warm in the summer."

The southwest corn chowder was fabulous (a special, not on the regular menu). The Moroccan lamb was tasty and interesting, with golden raisins and a mix of flavors, and Israeli-style large grain cons-cous. The veggie burger was thick and tasty - we feared it might be simulated meat, but no, it was a proper veggie burger, and quite good. Their list of specialty cocktails is interesting - I had the anejo sour, which was good, if pricey. They also had a good selection of beers (the Seapine IPA on draft was my partner's pick).
All-in-all, we liked The Blue Glass - located downhill of Phinney Ridge on 65th, it's a neighborhood joint with some spizazz. It was a bit pricey ... not outrageous, but more than I would expect for that kind of restaurant."

Where to start, my husband and I stumbled in here super late a couple days before Christmas!
It's a super cozy little restaurant with a great vibe. There were no children in there which was a godsend! I'm not sure if it's a family restaurant or if it's more of an 'adult only' setting but it was great to eat a meal without having to hear people's children.
Food was 10/10! The short ribs were some of the best I've ever had."

The lemongrass short rib kimchi Benedict was so decadent and flavorful. My friend and I also shared an apple streusel French toast and I was in sweet tooth heaven. The restaurant is 21+ which definitely made for a more peaceful brunch than you would usually experience"

Our cocktails were great! And we tried the smoked tuna toasts with Mama Lil's Peppers. DELICIOUS! I was so happy to find myself there again with friends last Friday. I was encouraged to go for it! -and try the Braised Short Ribs with polenta and sautéed rapini. The ribs practically melted in my mouth! A wonderful dish! Of course I ordered the smoked tuna toasts appetizer again, had to! I took a bite of my friends' Moroccan Lamb and Albondigas, and was in heaven!
The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and intimate. You are set up to have a wonderful time chatting it up with your company. Perfect night out, highly recommend"

It was a short, pleasant walk from our Airbnb. It had a great vibe inside - comfy and iconically picturesque at the same time.
The beer list was fairly extensive, and the beer tasted fresh.
We ordered pan fried brussels sprouts (awesome texture and perfectly cooked, but quite sweet - it could be a dessert), crab fritters (great flavor and super filling) as appetisers. For entrees, I had a Caesar salad with coho salmon (salad was meh and the fish was overcooked) and my wife had the pear arugula salad (good but nothing special).
They could have had an off night this particular Wednesday. Its got awesome ambiance, really good beer, but I would not recommend them for the food."

If you're in search of a restaurant to ""buy out"" for an evening that is a good fit for 50-ish people, definitely give The Blue Glass a look!
James at The Blue Glass worked with us to customize the night to meet our needs. The Blue Glass was flexible on menu and able to accommodate a variety of dietary constraints (including gluten-free and vegetarian). We ended up starting with buffet-style appetizers (Brussels sprouts and Dungeness crab fritters -- both a hit!) and then had plated entrees for the main course. We were able to give our guests the choice of three different entrees (lamb, salmon, and vegetarian risotto) which was great for accommodating various tastes. FYI they have beer, wine, and a full bar available, too.
Size-wise, the restaurant was a perfect fit for our group of 45-50. We filled it up nicely, and when it was time for a few toasts you could easily hear the speakers without needing microphones / audio equipment. (One less logistical item to worry about!) And since we had bought out the whole restaurant for the evening, there were no concerns about toasts disturbing other patrons!
The evening itself went off without a hitch. No delays, no food quality issues, and no worries for me and my partner! Afterwards, a number of guests commented on what a good spot it was for a rehearsal dinner. We would definitely host a rehearsal dinner here again: alas, for us, we hope that is a one-time sort of thing(!) -- so why don't you host yours here, instead?"
